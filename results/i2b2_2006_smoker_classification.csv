ADVERSE DRUG REACTIONS : Epistaxis to Coumadin in the past . PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE : Cardiac catheterization 11/03 . OTHER PROCEDURE : Pulmonary function test 11/04 . HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS : This 68-year-old patient of Dr. Naka Jesc had two episodes of rheumatic fever as a teenager . She has had chronic atrial fibrillation . Coumadin has caused bleeding from the mouth and nose on two occasions , on one occasion with prothrombin time 13 , and has been replaced by anti-platelet agents . She has had recurrent syncope since age 6 . She has now had progressive heart failure . A Holter showed atrial fibrillation with period of ventricular bigemini . She cut down dramatically on smoking two years ago , but has continued to smoke , although , very recently , she admits to only "" two puffs "" per day . She has not had hypertension or diabetes , and says he has lowered her cholesterol from 333 to 197 by changing her diet . There is no family history of heart disease . She has been treated with Vanceril for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease . She has had one gram per day proteinuria with normal creatinine . She had a partial gastrectomy in 1972 for a "" tumor "" . She has had an appendectomy and cholecystectomy . MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION : Digoxin 0.125 mg po q.d. , Lasix 40 mg b.i.d. , aspirin held , and Vanceril three puffs b.i.d. ALLERGIES : Transdermal nitroglycerin caused headache . SOCIAL HISTORY : She does not drink . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION : Heart rate 86 , irregularly irregular , blood pressure 142/86 . Neck veins distended . Carotids normal . Chest clear . Apical impulse not palpable . Right ventricular heave . S1 normal . S2 narrowly physiologically split with accentuation of P2 . No S3 or opening snap . Grade II systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border . Grade II decrescendo diastolic murmur at the left lower sternal border . Diastolic rumble at the apex . Liver slightly pulsatile but no enlarged . Pulses normal to the femorals with weak dorsalis pedis pulses . Superficial varicose veins . No edema . LABORATORY DATA : Hematocrit 44 , potassium 4.0 , BUN 23 , creatinine 1.2 , blood sugar 115 , Digoxin 1.4 . Electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation , moderate ventricular response , incomplete right bundle branch block , right axis deviation , right ventricular hypertrophy and possible apical infarction . Chest x-ray showed left atrial , right ventricular and pulmonary arterial enlargement and interstitial edema with small , bilateral effusions . HOSPITAL COURSE : Cardiac catheterization was performed without complication from the right neck and right groin on the day of admission . Right atrial pressure was 12 with a wave form consistent with tricuspid regurgitation . There was no tricuspid valve gradient . Pulmonary artery pressure was markedly elevated at 120/60 . Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was markedly elevated at 38 , with a very large mitral valve gradient . There was little or no aortic valve gradient . Fich cardiac output was 3.0 and indexed 2.0 . Arterial oxygen saturation was 85 percent . There was minimal mitral valve calcification , normal left ventricular contraction , and 2+ mitral regurgitation into a large left atrium . There was minimal aortic valve calcification , mild ______________ thickening , normal open , and mild aortic regurgitation . There was mild atherosclerosis of the mid left anterior descending . FVC was 1.6 or 58 percent of predicted and FEV1 0.95 or 45 percent of predicted . Room air arterial blood gas was 56/40/7.45 . Because it would be ideal to place a mechanical valve if valve replacement rather that commissurotomy is needed , she was seen by Dr. Ca Shuff of ENT for her history of epistaxis . He identified no bleeding source , but felt that the risk of nasal hemorrhage on Coumadin could be minimized interventional neuroradiology occlusion of the arteries to the nose bilaterally . The patient was therefore referred to the Dr. A Eu Wave . The procedure could not be scheduled during this admission . The patient is , therefore , discharged after a three day hospitalization , with plans for re-admission for the neuroradiology procedure . This will be followed by a trial of Coumadin , and then by mitral commissurotomy or replacement and probable tricuspid annuloplasty by Dr. Riemund C. Wave . In the meantime , Lasix dosage is increased . Potassium replacement has caused , according to the patient , marked hyperkalemia in the past . DISCHARGE REGIMEN : Digoxin 0.125 mg q.d. , Lasix 80 mg q.a.m. and 40 mg q.p.m. aspirin 1 q.d. , and Vanceril three puffs b.i.d.

Carotid stenosis . 2. Aortic stenosis . 3. Coronary artery disease . PRESENT ILLNESS : The patient is a 76-year-old female who was admitted to the medicine service on 04-29-92 with a past history significant for aortic stenosis and chest pain who presented for evaluation for aortic valve replace-ment . The patient has a history of exertional angina and chest pain associated with light-headedness for nine years which was noted to increase in frequency over the past year , then upon admission had light-headedness and chest pain with a dull pressure in her neck to her substernal area , with only minimal exertion such as "" walking across the room "" . She states this light-headedness is often associated with shortness of breath and diaphoresis occasionally with nausea . She denies any vomiting , states that the episodes usually last about five minutes and are relieved with rest . The pain and light-headedness is now severely lifestyle limiting and the patient requested evaluation for possible aortic valve replacement . Cardiac risk factors hypercholesterolemia , hypertension , no history of tobacco use , diabetes or family history . Past medical history is as stated above , aortic stenosis , found to be critical on echocardiogram on 4-13-92 , done in Otte A , New Jersey and was found to have left ventricular hypertrophy and ejection fraction of 58% , no right heart wall motion abnormali-ties and an aortic valve gradient of greater than 100 . She also has a history of uterine fibroids , status post total abdominal hysterectomy . She has known bilateral carotid disease , stated to be greater than 70% bilaterally . She has a history of glaucoma and a questionable history of claudication in her legs as well as a history of hypertension . Medications on admission were only aspirin p.r.n. and Timoptic solution 0.5% to the left eye twice a day . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION : On physical examination she was afebrile with a blood pressure of 170/100 , heart rate of 70 . HEENT examination notable for bilateral arcussenilis but otherwise unremarkable . Her neck showed no JVD , there was a slow carotid upstroke bilaterally , there were bilateral carotid bruits versus transmitted murmur . Chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally . Cardiac examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm with a normal S1 and S2 , 3/6 systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border , no gallop was detected . Her abdomen was soft , nontender with good bowel sounds . Extremi-ties : There is no clubbing , cyanosis or edema and her peripheral pulses were trace palpable . LAB / X-RAY DATA : Labs on admission : Sodium 141 , potassium 5.0 , BUN 18 , creatinine 1.0 , PT 12.3 , PTT 24 , WBC 7.6 , hematocrit 41 , platelets 278,000 . EKG revealed a normal sinus rhythm with a rate of 69 , left ventricular hyper-trophy with poor anterior progression of R-waves . HOSPITAL COURSE : She was admitted and evaluated by the cardiac surgery service after having undergone cardiac catheterization which revealed a 70% stenosis of her left circumflex artery , 50% stenosis of the left anterior descending and 10% stenosis of the right coronary artery . Carotid angiography revealed left internal carotid stenosis of 90% , right internal carotid artery "" critical stenosis "" . On 05-01-92 she was taken to the operating room at which time she underwent an aortic valve replacement with a # 19 St. Jude valve , coronary artery bypass graft times one with saphenous vein graft from the posterior descending artery to the obtuse marginal and right carotid endarterectomy . This was performed by Dr. Medicine and Dr. Room . The patient tolerated the procedure well and was found postoperatively to have some left upper extremity weakness on proximal greater than distal musculature . She was extubated on postoperative day number one and otherwise had an unremarkable postoperative course with the exception of her left upper extremity weakness . On 05-04-92 she was evaluated by the neurology service , who recommended a CT scan , however no evidence of infarction was detected . There was only diffuse small vessel disease noted . On 05-05-92 she was noted to convert to atrial fibrillation which resolved spontaneously a few days later . However , on 05-07-92 there was a a question of a new event with addition to the left upper extremity weakness , some noted right upper and right lower extremity discoordination . She was begun on a heparin drip . On 5-9-92 the right-sided symptoms worsened and she also had some elements of aphasia . She underwent angiography on 5-9-92 which showed the right internal carotid artery to be patent , however there was highly significant stenosis of the left carotid artery and she was taken to the operating room later that day for a left carotid endarterectomy . She was taken postoperatively the ICU where she was extubated on postoperative day number one and by 5-11-92 she was noted to have markedly increased use of her right side , resolving aphasia and she was transferred to the floor with the residual deficit only noted to be some left upper extremity weakness . She was worked up aggressively with the physical therapy and occupational services , made good progress and began ambulating with assistance with a walker but with minimal assistance from an aid . She was feeding herself and was very enthusiastic and energetic in her participation in her rehabilitation activities . She was maintained on heparin therapy initially but this was quickly switched over to Coumadin anticoagulation therapy which she will need to be on long-term for her aortic valve replacement . DISPOSITION : She is transferred to Rockdempbanri Hospital on 05-28-92 to continue her rehabilitation .

Carotid stenosis . 2. Aortic stenosis . 3. Coronary artery disease . PRESENT ILLNESS : The patient is a 76-year-old female who was admitted to the medicine service on 04-29-92 with a past history significant for aortic stenosis and chest pain who presented for evaluation for aortic valve replace-ment . The patient has a history of exertional angina and chest pain associated with light-headedness for nine years which was noted to increase in frequency over the past year , then upon admission had light-headedness and chest pain with a dull pressure in her neck to her substernal area , with only minimal exertion such as "" walking across the room "" . She states this light-headedness is often associated with shortness of breath and diaphoresis occasionally with nausea . She denies any vomiting , states that the episodes usually last about five minutes and are relieved with rest . The pain and light-headedness is now severely lifestyle limiting and the patient requested evaluation for possible aortic valve replacement . Cardiac risk factors hypercholesterolemia , hypertension , no history of tobacco use , diabetes or family history . Past medical history is as stated above , aortic stenosis , found to be critical on echocardiogram on 4-13-92 , done in Otte A , New Jersey and was found to have left ventricular hypertrophy and ejection fraction of 58% , no right heart wall motion abnormali-ties and an aortic valve gradient of greater than 100 . She also has a history of uterine fibroids , status post total abdominal hysterectomy . She has known bilateral carotid disease , stated to be greater than 70% bilaterally . She has a history of glaucoma and a questionable history of claudication in her legs as well as a history of hypertension . Medications on admission were only aspirin p.r.n. and Timoptic solution 0.5% to the left eye twice a day . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION : On physical examination she was afebrile with a blood pressure of 170/100 , heart rate of 70 . HEENT examination notable for bilateral arcussenilis but otherwise unremarkable . Her neck showed no JVD , there was a slow carotid upstroke bilaterally , there were bilateral carotid bruits versus transmitted murmur . Chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally . Cardiac examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm with a normal S1 and S2 , 3/6 systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border , no gallop was detected . Her abdomen was soft , nontender with good bowel sounds . Extremi-ties : There is no clubbing , cyanosis or edema and her peripheral pulses were trace palpable . LAB / X-RAY DATA : Labs on admission : Sodium 141 , potassium 5.0 , BUN 18 , creatinine 1.0 , PT 12.3 , PTT 24 , WBC 7.6 , hematocrit 41 , platelets 278,000 . EKG revealed a normal sinus rhythm with a rate of 69 , left ventricular hyper-trophy with poor anterior progression of R-waves . HOSPITAL COURSE : She was admitted and evaluated by the cardiac surgery service after having undergone cardiac catheterization which revealed a 70% stenosis of her left circumflex artery , 50% stenosis of the left anterior descending and 10% stenosis of the right coronary artery . Carotid angiography revealed left internal carotid stenosis of 90% , right internal carotid artery "" critical stenosis "" . On 05-01-92 she was taken to the operating room at which time she underwent an aortic valve replacement with a # 19 St. Jude valve , coronary artery bypass graft times one with saphenous vein graft from the posterior descending artery to the obtuse marginal and right carotid endarterectomy . This was performed by Dr. Medicine and Dr. Room . The patient tolerated the procedure well and was found postoperatively to have some left upper extremity weakness on proximal greater than distal musculature . She was extubated on postoperative day number one and otherwise had an unremarkable postoperative course with the exception of her left upper extremity weakness . On 05-04-92 she was evaluated by the neurology service , who recommended a CT scan , however no evidence of infarction was detected . There was only diffuse small vessel disease noted . On 05-05-92 she was noted to convert to atrial fibrillation which resolved spontaneously a few days later . However , on 05-07-92 there was a a question of a new event with addition to the left upper extremity weakness , some noted right upper and right lower extremity discoordination . She was begun on a heparin drip . On 5-9-92 the right-sided symptoms worsened and she also had some elements of aphasia . She underwent angiography on 5-9-92 which showed the right internal carotid artery to be patent , however there was highly significant stenosis of the left carotid artery and she was taken to the operating room later that day for a left carotid endarterectomy . She was taken postoperatively the ICU where she was extubated on postoperative day number one and by 5-11-92 she was noted to have markedly increased use of her right side , resolving aphasia and she was transferred to the floor with the residual deficit only noted to be some left upper extremity weakness . She was worked up aggressively with the physical therapy and occupational services , made good progress and began ambulating with assistance with a walker but with minimal assistance from an aid . She was feeding herself and was very enthusiastic and energetic in her participation in her rehabilitation activities .

The patient experienced a brief episode of loss of consciousness while driving her car two weeks prior to admission , at which time she collided with the car in front of her and rapidly regained consciousness . There was no aura , no witnessed seizure activity and no post ictal symptoms . The patient has a history of ventricular premature beats for which she was treated with Flecainide . After the syncopal episode the patient was evaluated at a local hospital with head and abdominal CT , EEG , and EKG , all of which were normal . Her Flecainide was discontinued and she was referred to CTMC for further evaluation . The patient has history of VPBs as noted above , treated with Flecainide with good symptomatic response .

It was felt that these lesions were unrelated to the patient 's episode , and were unlikely to cause her significant distress . On the following day , she was taken to electrophysiologic study . During the study , the right bundle branch was hit by the catheter , inducing a right bundle branch block . Following this , upon rapid atrial pacing at a rate of 120 , there was revealed a bifascicular left block , which combined with the right bundle branch block caused a complete heart block .

Unsigned DIS Report Status : Unsigned ADMISSION DATE : 01/18/94 DISCHARGE DATE : 02/02/94 PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS : Coronary artery disease and carotid stenosis . ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSES : ( 1 ) hypertension . ( 2 ) diabetes mellitus . PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE : 1/25/94 : Urgent right carotid endarterectomy and coronary artery bypass graft . HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS : The patient is a 76 year old white female who was transferred from Oneoremadi Ryviewmawpa Greecounbci with severe coronary artery disease and presented for coronary artery bypass grafting . The patient overall had been in her usual state of good health until three to four months prior when she developed progressively worsening chest pain exacerbated bystress . In retrospect she has had several years of rare episodes of chest pain attributed to indigestion . On 01/14/94 she underwent a Persantine-thallium test at Lichampm Kane Ancester Medical Center which showed anterolateralischemia and she also developed chest pain during her study . She was admitted for cardiac catheterization which on transfer today showed severe left main disease with occluded right coronary artery and 95 percent stenosis of the circumflex with severe proximal left anterior descending . She was transferred to TGCHO for surgical evaluation and was stable throughout except for some chest pain during her cardiac catheterization relieved with morphine and intravenous nitroglycerin . PAST MEDICAL HISTORY : Is above above , as well as ( 2 ) non-insulin diabetes mellitus which she is controlled on oral hypoglycemics , and ( 3 ) hypertension . ALLERGIES : None . MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION : Tenormin 25 mg b.i.d. , Vasotec 10 mg q.d. , Diabinase 250 mg b.i.d. , nitroglycerin paste to chest wall , enteric coated aspirin one tablet PO q.d. , heparin intravenously , Dyazide 1 tablet PO q.d.

She was a pleasant obese white female in no acute distress . HEENT examination was within normal limits ; neck was without adenopathy , lungs were clear to auscultation and percussion ; heart regular rate and rhythm with distant heart sounds . Abdomen was benign . Extremities : without deformities or varicosities . Vascular showed 2 plus pulses except for her dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses which were one plus . She had a left carotid bruit . HOSPITAL COURSE : Given the patient 's severe three vessel coronary artery disease a Cardiac Surgery consult was obtained for possible coronary artery bypass grafting . She was kept on intravenous heparin , nitroglycerin and beta blockade . Regarding her carotid bruit a carotid non-invasive study was obtained which showed severe right internal carotid artery stenosis and moderate left internal carotid artery stenosis . In conjunction with the cardiac surgeons Dr. Ausguall from the Vascular Surgery Service was consulted for carotid endarterectomy on the right . In anticipation of her endarterectomy she underwent an MRA angiogram on 01/22/94 . Results of the angiogram showed that she right internal carotid artery stenosis with some hemodynamic effect in the distal LCA lumen diameter . Due to this result an urgent carotid endarterectomy along with her coronary artery bypass graft was performed on 1/25/94 . There were no complications and postoperatively she was transferred to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit in stable condition . She remained neurologically intact and did well from the Vascular Surgery stand point . Her Intensive Care Unit stay was only notable for an increase in chest tube output which subsequently decreased and was removed prior to her transfer to the floor . She had some ectopy , specifically frequent ectopic activity after her surgery for which a Cardiac Arrhythmia Service consult was obtained and she was put on a Holter monitor and echocardiogram was obtained . She remained hemodynamically stable and wires were kept intact beyond postoperative day four since she had some evidence of heart block . Her beta blocker was held and she continued to be in sinus rhythm versus atrial fibrillation with frequent premature ventricular contractions . Echocardiogram revealed her left ventricle to be within normal limits and otherwise her study was negative . Holter monitor results were pending at the time of discharge . Wires were subsequently discontinued and her digoxin and beta blocker were discontinued . Otherwise her hospital course was uneventful .

Pathology showed grade III adenocarcinoma 50% invasive metastatic to endocervical mucosa , no sternal invasion . Negative nodes , negative omentum , negative Pap , negative washings making her a stage 2A . She was treated with pelvic radiation from 02-92 to 03-92 . She received 5000 CGY . On 01-92 , she developed left hip pain and stayed to fall on 03-92 . She was found to have metastatic disesae to the left ischium , met to left buttocks and small bilateral pleural effusions . Orthopedics felt that these were lytic lesion to the left ischium . She was treated with daily XRT complicated by discrimination of gluteal skin and Candida infection and vaginal bleeding . Therefore , this was discontinued . She was sent to Usoak Rinix Hospital for further rehabil-itation but she was unable to tolerate any weight on the left hip secondary to increasing left hip pain . She is now admitted for pain management and anemia . PAST MEDICAL HISTORY : Hypertension , borderline diabetes , anal fissure .

Nonpitting edema . LABORATORY DATA : Hematocrit of 24.3 , white count 16.6 , platelet count 560 , electrolytes within normal limits . LFT's are within normal limits . LDH of 754 . Albumin of 2 . HOSPITAL COURSE : The patient is a 67-year-old gravida 7 , para 7 white female with metastatic endometrial carcinoma who presented with increasing left lower extremity pain for pain management , anemia , diarrhea . For her anemia , she received two units of packed red blood cells and tolerated this well . Hematocrit was 29-30 after her two units of packed red blood cells . For her increasing left lower extremity pain , she received a pain service consult . Deep venous thrombosis was ruled out , negative lower extremity noninvasive tests . The Pain Service started her on MSR Contin and Amitriptyline . After a few days , she found great relief from her left hip pain . She still , however , was unable to move it adequately with the aid of Physical Therapy . She began having some hallucinations which she felt were real . Psychiatry was consulted and they suggested stopping her Amitriptyline which was done and adding Haldol 1 mg at night and b.i.d. as needed . Because she had increasing tremors and hallucinations . Neurology felt that her hallucinations were also most likely due to pain medication and her tremors were enhanced physiological tremor and they suggested trying Mescaline at low doses . It was felt that the MS Contin should be stopped and that she should be started on a PCA . She was therefore started on a PCA with constant infusion of 0.3 mg / hour and a rescue dose of 0.1 mg every ten minutes times three doses / hour . She was also started on Mescaline 60 mg p.o. q. day for her tremor . Also , while in the hospital , the patient developed a Klebsiella pneumonia UTI for which she received seven days of Ancef because she continues to require an indwelling Foley , she was started on Bactrim double strength one p.o. q. day as prophylaxis . The patient 's cultures from her stool returned positive for C-difficile toxin . She was , therefore , started on 7-15-91 on Vancomycin 250 mg p.o. q.i.d. She will continue on this until 7-25-91 . Her diarrhea has resolved on this medication . The patient also underwent chemotherapy treatment during this hospital visit . She first had a Hickman line placed for chemotherapy on 7-17-92 . She tolerated this procedure well and the Hickman line has continued to function well . She had a 24-hour urine which had a creatinine clearance of 57 and a normal RBG with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 63% . Her chemotherapy was not started until 7-19-92 because the treatment had been started for her C-difficile . By 7-20 , her diarrhea had resolved and she was started on chemotherapy . She received Adriamycin 54 mg times two and 200 mg / meter squared of Carbo . She tolerated this chemotherapy well . She will get biweekly laboratory results followed . She also was found to have Candida UTI and was treated for two days with Ampicillin , bladder irritation and follow-up culture was negative . DISPOSITION : It was felt that the patient required care facility placement and she will be continued on PCA for her pain management . Therefore , appropriate chronic care facilities were investigated . DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS : Triacetate 750 mg p.o. t.i.d. ; Atenolol 100 mg p.o. q. day ; Dulcolax one p.o. q. day ; Aquaphor Cream to buttocks p.r.n. ; Senokot one p.o. q. day ; Vancomycin 25 mg p.o. q. 6 hours until 1-20 ; Bactrim double strength one p.o. q. day ; Haldol 1 mg p.o. q. h.s. ; PCA allotted 0.3 mg / hour , rescue dose 0.1 mg every ten minutes three times an hour ; Mysoline 50 mg p.o. q. h.s. A CBC and SMA-20 should be checked weekly and the results will be followed by the chemotherapy nurse treating . She will be followed by Dr. Beceneigh .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS AND REASON FOR ADMISSION : Mr. Bath is a 77-year-old retired psychologist who was admitted because of a fall . He has a history of failing memory and difficulty with gait , dating back to 1993 when he had a cat scan which was said to be unremarkable , however , over the past year he has progressively deteriorated in terms of his memory and mental function and over the past six months has rapidly deterioratedwith his gait so that it has recently been very difficult for him to maintain his balance and walk unassisted . Finally , he fell in his bath tub and was unable to get up . A nursing assessment thought that it was unsafe for the patient to be at home so he was admitted to the hospital for evaluation . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION : there was no evidence of serious trauma . His general examination revealed a blood pressure of 145/80 ; pulse of 72 and regular . He was in no acute distress . His neck was supple . The chest was normal . The cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs noted . The carotids were normal . There were no bruits . There was some paravertebral tenderness over the lumbar sign but this was not severe . The abdomen was soft and non-tender and slightly distended but bowel sounds were present . There were no masses noted . The Extremities examination revealed no edema . Pulses were palpable .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS : This is a 63 year old patient who had no significant medical history until 1987 , when he developed a left arm embolism which was treated with SVG from the left thigh . The postop course was uncomplicated with an embolus occluding the graft and a CVA . In 04-90 , the patient suffered an intestinal embolism requiring an ileostomy which was closed in 09-90 . In 09-90 , the patient developed a second CVA presenting with slurred speech which resolved without residual . The patient presents now with a 3 month history of dizziness and mood changes . He also complains of continued left arm paresthesias . The patient also reports that he had a large silent MI in 01-89 , which was uncomplicated . HOSPITAL COURSE : After admission to the Medical Service , the patient underwent work up for embolism source and source for his dizziness . His search had previously been negative . A recent echo showed 1+ MR , inferior apical and left ventricular akinesis and a 3 x 2.5 cm spherical mass in the inferior apical left ventricle . This finding was in concurrence with findings of a cardiac cath performed on 2-12-92 . The patient was then transferred to the Cardiac Surgery Service for the removal of this left ventricular mass . Coronary angiography during the cardiac cath had revealed normal coronaries without coronary artery disease . After the usual preparation , the patient was taken to the OR on 2-14-92 , and underwent left ventriculotomy and removal of the left ventricular thrombus . The pathological examination of the removed material revealed a blood clot with thrombus . The patient tolerated the procedure well . During the early postop period , he was kept on IV Dextran and was restarted on Coumadin . His further postop course was complicated by a recurrent episode of dizziness . His neurologic work up , however , was negative . A repeat echo showed no recurrent intraventricular thrombus and a carotid Doppler study was negative . The patient suffered no further dizzy spells during the further postop days . He was discharged in good condition on 2-22-92 .

FOLLOW UP CARE : Since our Hematology consultant recommended to keep the patient 's PT in the range of 20-22 seconds , the patient will require close follow up of his PT's while on Coumadin . This was discussed with the patient 's local medical doctor , Dr. Royneo Walla . The patient will receive further follow up including evoked potential studies by our Neurology Service .

However , the patient developed left IIIrd nerve palsy and an MRI showed increasing lesion in the left ______________ cerebral peduncle and the left mid brain . The patient was reinduced with high dose methotrexate , 8 mg / meter sq. with some initial tumor response . However , when the patient was started on 3.5 gm / meter sq. maintenance dose , the tumor progressed . At that point , the patient was switched over toe high-dose ARA-C ( 2.5 gm / meter sq ) . On the high-dose ARA-C chemotherapy , the patient developed bone marrow suppression requiring intermittent Neupogen ( GCSF ) support . The patient was recently discharged from the hospital after her second cycle of high-dose ARA-C chemotherapy . The patient remained stable to the last few days prior to admission when she developed insidious rectal bleeding , probably from her external hemorrhoids , along with decreasing platelet count . On the day of admission the patient 's platelet count dropped to 28,000 and the patient was admitted for her platelet transfusions and further work up for her rectal bleeding .

The patient 's platelet count improved to 76,000 on the following morning ; however , her white blood count dropped to 900 with 58 polys with 8 bands . Because of significant neutropenia , the patient was put on reverse isolation and started on GCSF injections . The patient 's white blood count improved with the GCSF and her counts went up to 18.2 on the day of discharge . The patient 's hemoglobin improved to 10.0 after the transfusion and her rectal bleeding apparently stopped .

SPECIAL PROCEDURES AND OPERATIONS : A temporary pacemaker on 5/4/92 , coronary angiogram and left and right heart catheterization on 5/5/92 , and permanent VVI-pacemaker on 5/6/92 , using an Intermedex pacemaker at 292-03 number , and set in the VVI mode with an escape rate of 65 . MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE : Zestril , 10 , b.i.d. , coumadin , to be regulated , digoxin , 0.125 mg. , alternating with 0.25 , every other day , verapamil , 80 , 4 times a day , Asthmacort , four puffs , b.i.d. , Atrovent , 2 puffs , 4 times a day , and quinine sulfate , 325 , q.h.s. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS : This patient is a 77 year old female who has had a Hancock mitral valve replacement on 10/28/76 by Dr. Melvean Ace . She had a bypass graft with marginal artery at that time , with a flow of 85 cc. 's . She subsequently had done well , although she had had chronic obstructive lung disease . She had been converted to normal sinus rhythm in 1977 , but in 1988 , the mitral valve on an echocardiogram was O.K. Her ejection fraction was 81% , with no mitral regurgitation seen , with a peak gradient of 9 and a mean gradient of about 3 . In 1988 , she developed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma , and has been followed by Dr. Times , as well as the pulmonologist down where she lives . She had been in and out of atrial flutter and fibrillation most of the time for the last few years . She , on one occasion , had sinus rhythm very briefly . Dr. Avejoh Wierst at the Pedines Community Hospital found her to be in congestive heart failure on two occasions over the last six weeks or so . A TEE showed minimal mitral regurgitation and good left ventricular function . Nevertheless , because of recurrent failure , it was felt that she should be transferred up to the Bri Health for further evaluation . HOSPITAL COURSE : On examination here , I could hear no mitral regurgitation murmur . The observation in the hospital showed that she had recurrent runs of rapid atrial fibrillation as well as rapid supraventricular tachycardia going around 130 . This was on diltiazem and digoxin . At the same time , she had two 0.4 second pauses intermittently . Because of this , the diltiazem was stopped , and she was further observed . We could not catheterize her right away because her prothrombin time was a little too high . Over the weekend of observation , she continued to be in supraventricular tachycardia , but also developed a 4.4 second pause on digoxin alone , which was in low therapeutic range . She also had supraventricular tachycardia which was going up to 160 . Therefore , a temporary pacemaker that put in on 5/4 , and diltiazem was restarted . A cardiac catheterization was carried out on 5/5 , once her prothrombin time had fully normalized . It showed that she had a large big right dominant coronary artery , which was free of any significant disease . The graft to the marginal artery was open , with good runoff into a large vessel . The left anterior descending had perhaps a mid-40% lesion only , with good left ventricular contraction and no mitral regurgitation seen on left ventricular angiogram . There was a very modest to moderate mitral valve gradient . The mitral valve area was calculated at 1.2 square centimeters , and then with modest exercise , the mitral valve area calculated to 1.7 square centimeters . Thus , she had , at the most , modest mitral stenosis of no clinical significance . With this data in hand , it appeared that her previous congestive episodes was probably related to sustained periods of rapid heart action with minimal mitral stenosis . A permanent pacemaker was put in on 5/6/92 . This was an Intermedex 292-03 pacemaker , set in the VVI mode with an escape rate of 65 . She tolerated the procedure well . On diltiazem , 60 , q.i.d. , she continued to have supraventricular tachycardia , running at around 130 , so we switched her over to verapamil , four times a day , along with digoxin , 0.125 , alternating with 0.25 , qD , which gave her a blood level of 1.0 . On this program , she is now beginning to ambulate with a heart rate of around 79-80 , and is starting to feel a lot better . We will ambulate her over the next couple of days . We have stopped her Lasix , and we will be watching her daily weight , and that has been quite stable . If she remains stable over the next couple of days , she will be discharged on this program , to be followed jointly by Dr. Avejoh Wierst and Dr. Em Neighburce . EM Z.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS : This patient is a 77 year old female who has had a Hancock mitral valve replacement on 10/28/76 by Dr. Melvean Ace . She had a bypass graft with marginal artery at that time , with a flow of 85 cc. 's . She subsequently had done well , although she had had chronic obstructive lung disease . She had been converted to normal sinus rhythm in 1977 , but in 1988 , the mitral valve on an echocardiogram was O.K. Her ejection fraction was 81% , with no mitral regurgitation seen , with a peak gradient of 9 and a mean gradient of about 3 . In 1988 , she developed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma , and has been followed by Dr. Times , as well as the pulmonologist down where she lives . She had been in and out of atrial flutter and fibrillation most of the time for the last few years . She , on one occasion , had sinus rhythm very briefly . Dr. Avejoh Wierst at the Pedines Community Hospital found her to be in congestive heart failure on two occasions over the last six weeks or so . A TEE showed minimal mitral regurgitation and good left ventricular function . Nevertheless , because of recurrent failure , it was felt that she should be transferred up to the Bri Health for further evaluation . HOSPITAL COURSE : On examination here , I could hear no mitral regurgitation murmur . The observation in the hospital showed that she had recurrent runs of rapid atrial fibrillation as well as rapid supraventricular tachycardia going around 130 . This was on diltiazem and digoxin . At the same time , she had two 0.4 second pauses intermittently . Because of this , the diltiazem was stopped , and she was further observed . We could not catheterize her right away because her prothrombin time was a little too high . Over the weekend of observation , she continued to be in supraventricular tachycardia , but also developed a 4.4 second pause on digoxin alone , which was in low therapeutic range . She also had supraventricular tachycardia which was going up to 160 . Therefore , a temporary pacemaker that put in on 5/4 , and diltiazem was restarted . A cardiac catheterization was carried out on 5/5 , once her prothrombin time had fully normalized . It showed that she had a large big right dominant coronary artery , which was free of any significant disease . The graft to the marginal artery was open , with good runoff into a large vessel . The left anterior descending had perhaps a mid-40% lesion only , with good left ventricular contraction and no mitral regurgitation seen on left ventricular angiogram . There was a very modest to moderate mitral valve gradient . The mitral valve area was calculated at 1.2 square centimeters , and then with modest exercise , the mitral valve area calculated to 1.7 square centimeters . Thus , she had , at the most , modest mitral stenosis of no clinical significance . With this data in hand , it appeared that her previous congestive episodes was probably related to sustained periods of rapid heart action with minimal mitral stenosis . A permanent pacemaker was put in on 5/6/92 . This was an Intermedex 292-03 pacemaker , set in the VVI mode with an escape rate of 65 . She tolerated the procedure well . On diltiazem , 60 , q.i.d. , she continued to have supraventricular tachycardia , running at around 130 , so we switched her over to verapamil , four times a day , along with digoxin , 0.125 , alternating with 0.25 , qD , which gave her a blood level of 1.0 . On this program , she is now beginning to ambulate with a heart rate of around 79-80 , and is starting to feel a lot better . We will ambulate her over the next couple of days . We have stopped her Lasix , and we will be watching her daily weight , and that has been quite stable . If she remains stable over the next couple of days , she will be discharged on this program , to be followed jointly by Dr. Avejoh Wierst and Dr. Em Neighburce . EM Z.

BACK - no flank tenderness RECTAL -- deferred EXT - WWP ; no edema On 04/06/05 Mr. Liley was admitted to Dr. Liley 's service . At that time he was made NPO with IVF , placed on Ampicillin / Levofloxacin / Flagyl and underwent IR placement of a drainage catheter for his abdominopelvic fluid collection . Overnight he spiked a fever to 103 and his WBC climbed from 11 to 13 . As a result , IR reviewed the patient 's post-procedure imaging and felt that the catheter was not adequately draining the patient 's fluid collection . On 04/07 they took the patient back to the IR suite and placed a second catheter . The location of the second catheter was confirmed that evening by a follow-up scan which revealed good placement . The following day the patient defervesced . Neurologic : The patient 's pain from his catheters was controlled with Oxycodone and Motrin . CV : No active issues . R : The patient received chest PT and was encouraged to ambulate frequently . GI : After catheter placement , the patient was started on sips . He tolerated this well . He was advanced to clears which he tolerated and was restarted on a low residue diet . His bowel function resumed and in fact he had loose stool . He had 3 specimens sent for C. difficile which were negative . GU : The patient 's electrolytes and fluids were monitored closely during his admission . Heme : The patient 's WBC trended down to 10.7 at discharge from a peak of 13 on 04/07 . His hematocrit remained stable . He received DVT prophylaxis with SC Heparin . ID : Blood cultures 04/05 revealed Bacteroides fragilis ; 04/06 Fluid collection drainage from IR revealed 1) 4+ alpha hemolytic Strep , 2) 2+ E. coli sensitive to Ampicillin and Levofloxacin , 3) 3+ Enterococci sensitive to Ampicillin and Levofloxacin , 4) Bacteroides fragilis and Clostridium perfringens . Blood cultures from 04/07 showed NGTD . Cdiff from 04/08 , 04/09 , 04/10 were negative . Mr. Liley was discharged in stable condition , ambulating and voiding independently , and with adequate pain control . LDAMC services were set-up for care of his IR drains . He was given explicit instructions to follow-up in clinic with Dr. Liley in 1-2 weeks . ADDENDUM : An abscessogram was performed on 04/12/05 and revealed no fistula .

Renagel 800 mg four times per day . BRIEF HISTORY : She is a 57-year-old chronic dialysis patient who was admitted with an occluded right forearm dialysis AV graft and hyperkalemia . The patient underwent dialysis AV graft thrombectomy and this was complicated by poor result due to stenosis and fibrosed nature of graft . She subsequently had swelling of her left arm and ongoing hyperkalemia which was managed with Kayexalate . She was admitted to reestablish dialysis angio access and to optimize dialysis indices . PREVIOUS HISTORY : 1. Endstage renal disease due to polycystic kidney disease status post failed transplant on chronic hemodialysis at Nigrand Hospital And Medical Center . 2. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease . 3. Restless leg syndrome . 4. Abdominal aortic aneurysm . 5. Hyperlipidemia . 6. History of coronary artery disease status post MI . ADMISSION MEDICATIONS : 1. Atenolol . 2. Aspirin . 3. Quinine . 4. Mirapex . 5. Renagel . 6. Nephrocaps . 7. Protonix . 8. Lipitor . 9. Albuterol . 10. Atrovent . SOCIAL HISTORY : The patient is married . She is a chronic smoker . REVIEW OF SYSTEMS : As detailed in fellow and nurse practitioner notes . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION : PHYSICAL EXAMINATION : Afebrile . Vital signs stable . Blood pressure 90/40 to 110/60 . Alert and orientated . Pleasant . Chest : Clear anteriorly and at bases . Normal cardiac sounds . Ejection systolic murmur . Abdomen : Benign . Right forearm : AV graft with extensive hematoma and ecchymosis and difficulty to access . ADMISSION LABORATORY DATA : Potassium 6.3 down to 4.8 , calcium 8.3 , phosphorus 5 . BUN 35 , creatinine 5.9 , hematocrit 34.9 . HOSPITAL COURSE : 1. Dialysis : She received dialysis via a remnant of her AV graft but clearance was suboptimal and graft will not be usable over the long-term . She was therefore referred for a dialysis tunneled angiocatheter and will be seen by the surgical service as an outpatient for elective revision of her AV graft surgically . Her potassium was stable postdialysis in the 4 range . Her hematocrit was however low and with followup pending . The patient has chronic outpatient dialysis at Nigrand Hospital And Medical Center and communication regarding her angio access status will be performed . 2. Cardiovascular : The patient has a history of ischemic heart disease . She had labile blood pressure following dialysis likely related to fluid removal and then sedating medications for catheter placement . She resolved spontaneously with small fluid bolus and with no further difficulties . 3. Metabolic : Hyperkalemia as noted . Now stable with reestablishment of vascular access . Anemia : Probably a component of CKD , dilutional and blood loss with procedures . Pending reevaluation will be monitored in an outpatient setting . Increase dose of EPO . No need for transfusion at this stage given the patient is asymptomatic and no episodes of GI bleeding documented . The patient will follow up with her primary nephrologist at the Nigrand Hospital And Medical Center and with Dr. N Tland at DH . She will have scheduled appointment made through the vascular access program for access revision .

However , the patient developed crescendo pattern angina pectoris and presented on the day of admission . PAST MEDICAL HISTORY : As above . MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION : Lipitor . Lopressor . Aspirin . Imdur . Nitroglycerin prn . ALLERGIES : No known drug allergies . SOCIAL HISTORY : The patient lives with is wife . TOBACCO : History of heavy smoking in the past . PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION : Blood pressure 112 , Sa02 96% , afebrile . Lungs clear . S1 , S2 . No significant murmurs . Abdomen : Obese and soft . Extremities : Without edema . HOSPITAL COURSE : The patient was admitted to the floor with variable changes in his EKG . He became pain free in the Emergency Room and was initially admitted to Evinlandcalco Hospital . However , he developed recurrent chest discomfort on the floor with worsening of his anterior ST segments with elevation , and he was taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory . In the cardiac catheterization laboratory , right heart catheterization showed RA 7 , RV 36/9 , wedge 16 . He was treated with Integrelin in addition to his intravenous heparin , aspirin , and nitrates . He was found to have the left anterior descending occluded proximally with right to left collaterals . The circumflex was codominant with severe 90% lesion proximally in the circumflex and 50% lesion in a large OM . The right coronary artery was codominant and had an ostial stenosis in the 70% range . Left ventriculography revealed an akinetic anterolateral wall . A balloon pump was placed and right heart catheterization was performed showing the above . The patient developed worsening ST elevation on the monitor and the decision was made to go ahead and open the left anterior descending . The procedure was reasonably complicated in that the left anterior descending had poor re-flow and two stents needed to be placed , as there was a second lesion in the mid left anterior descending . The distal vessel was quite diseased and poor with regard to vessel quality and caliber . A good result was obtained with a stent in the proximal left anterior descending and a stent in the mid left anterior descending and the patient went to the Intensive Care Unit on a balloon pump , intubated . His peak CPK was in the 3000 range . The patient developed hemoptysis while intubated and on Integrelin and heparin . He underwent bronchoscopy , which showed no specific lesion . In addition , chest CT showed no obvious reason for his hemoptysis , with the exception of atelectasis . It was felt that perhaps the patient had atelectasis and perhaps some aspiration , which predisposed him to hemoptysis . In addition , the patient had confusion and delirium . Head CT was without any obvious intracranial catastrophe . He was seen in consultation by the Neurology and Psychiatry services and felt to have cognitive deficits and was ultimately controlled and managed with a combination of Seroquel and Haldol . In addition , the patient had a sitter during parts of his hospital course to keep him oriented . The patient had a return to the cardiac catheterization lab on 2/2/02 to receive a stent to the tight circumflex . This was uneventful , without the need for intubation , etc , and the procedure went smoothly . He tolerated it well . The ostial right coronary was a relatively small vessel for the patient and was not approached this admission . The patient was transferred to Evinlandcalco Hospital . He had difficulties with urinary incontinence and required straight catheterization for post-void residuals up until the time of this dictation . He was still having 300 cc or so post-void remaining in his bladder . He is followed by Dr. Squithsherl in this regard . At the time of this dictation , the plan is for probable transfer to a rehabilitation facility for physical therapy . He has had no recurrent heart angina pectoris or heart failure . Of note , cardiac echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction in the 40% range with apical akinesis .
