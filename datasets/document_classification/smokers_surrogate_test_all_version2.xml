PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Mitral stenosis
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :

ADVERSE DRUG REACTIONS :
Epistaxis to Coumadin in the past .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
Cardiac catheterization 11/03 .
OTHER PROCEDURE :
Pulmonary function test 11/04 .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This 68-year-old patient of Dr. Naka Jesc had two episodes of rheumatic fever as a teenager .
She has had chronic atrial fibrillation .
Coumadin has caused bleeding from the mouth and nose on two occasions , on one occasion with prothrombin time 13 , and has been replaced by anti-platelet agents .
She has had recurrent syncope since age 6 .
She has now had progressive heart failure .
A Holter showed atrial fibrillation with period of ventricular bigemini .
She cut down dramatically on smoking two years ago , but has continued to smoke , although , very recently , she admits to only &quot; two puffs &quot; per day .
She has not had hypertension or diabetes , and says he has lowered her cholesterol from 333 to 197 by changing her diet .
There is no family history of heart disease .
She has been treated with Vanceril for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .
She has had one gram per day proteinuria with normal creatinine .
She had a partial gastrectomy in 1972 for a &quot; tumor &quot; .
She has had an appendectomy and cholecystectomy .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Digoxin 0.125 mg po q.d. , Lasix 40 mg b.i.d. , aspirin held , and Vanceril three puffs b.i.d.
ALLERGIES :
Transdermal nitroglycerin caused headache .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
She does not drink .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Heart rate 86 , irregularly irregular , blood pressure 142/86 .
Neck veins distended .
Carotids normal .
Chest clear .
Apical impulse not palpable .
Right ventricular heave .
S1 normal .
S2 narrowly physiologically split with accentuation of P2 .
No S3 or opening snap .
Grade II systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border .
Grade II decrescendo diastolic murmur at the left lower sternal border .
Diastolic rumble at the apex .
Liver slightly pulsatile but no enlarged .
Pulses normal to the femorals with weak dorsalis pedis pulses .
Superficial varicose veins .
No edema .
LABORATORY DATA :
Hematocrit 44 , potassium 4.0 , BUN 23 , creatinine 1.2 , blood sugar 115 , Digoxin 1.4 .
Electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation , moderate ventricular response , incomplete right bundle branch block , right axis deviation , right ventricular hypertrophy and possible apical infarction .
Chest x-ray showed left atrial , right ventricular and pulmonary arterial enlargement and interstitial edema with small , bilateral effusions .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Cardiac catheterization was performed without complication from the right neck and right groin on the day of admission .
Right atrial pressure was 12 with a wave form consistent with tricuspid regurgitation .
There was no tricuspid valve gradient .
Pulmonary artery pressure was markedly elevated at 120/60 .
Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was markedly elevated at 38 , with a very large mitral valve gradient .
There was little or no aortic valve gradient .
Fich cardiac output was 3.0 and indexed 2.0 .
Arterial oxygen saturation was 85 percent .
There was minimal mitral valve calcification , normal left ventricular contraction , and 2+ mitral regurgitation into a large left atrium .
There was minimal aortic valve calcification , mild ______________ thickening , normal open , and mild aortic regurgitation .
There was mild atherosclerosis of the mid left anterior descending .
FVC was 1.6 or 58 percent of predicted and FEV1 0.95 or 45 percent of predicted .
Room air arterial blood gas was 56/40/7.45 .
Because it would be ideal to place a mechanical valve if valve replacement rather that commissurotomy is needed , she was seen by Dr. Ca Shuff of ENT for her history of epistaxis .
He identified no bleeding source , but felt that the risk of nasal hemorrhage on Coumadin could be minimized interventional neuroradiology occlusion of the arteries to the nose bilaterally .
The patient was therefore referred to the Dr. A Eu Wave .
The procedure could not be scheduled during this admission .
The patient is , therefore , discharged after a three day hospitalization , with plans for re-admission for the neuroradiology procedure .
This will be followed by a trial of Coumadin , and then by mitral commissurotomy or replacement and probable tricuspid annuloplasty by Dr. Riemund C. Wave .
In the meantime , Lasix dosage is increased .
Potassium replacement has caused , according to the patient , marked hyperkalemia in the past .
DISCHARGE REGIMEN :
Digoxin 0.125 mg q.d. , Lasix 80 mg q.a.m. and 40 mg q.p.m. aspirin 1 q.d. , and Vanceril three puffs b.i.d.

She was oriented to person , place , time and purpose , she recalled three out of three objects at five minutes , she is able to do calculations .
She maintained her fixation on the conversation well .
The cranial nerve exam :
pupils reactive to light , extra ocular movements show good upgaze up to 3 mm. , good down gaze .

Gastroc. 3 on the left and 4+ on the right .
Tibialis 3 on the left , 5+ on the right .
Reflexes were diffuse 3+ , toes upgoing bilaterally .
LABORATORY DATA :
On admission , electrocardiogram showed less than 1 mm. of ST depression in V4 to V6 , which is likely the patient &apos;s baseline .
CK &apos;s were mildly elevated but the MB fractions were not remarkable .
A chest X-ray showed some left lower lobe atelectasis .
Admitting creatinine was .7 , glucose 131 , white blood count was 10,000 , hematocrit was 40 , liver enzymes normal range .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was taken to the Intensive Care Unit after her angiogram .
She was aggressively anticoagulated with heparin .
A small intimal tear in the arch of the aorta during the angiogram , was without sequelae .
She was doing well with at least 4+ strength in all of her extremities , when on 11/13 , she had an acute drop in her systolic blood pressure to 70 for unclear reasons and without evidence of acute sepsis .
This was accompanied by substantial decrement in neurologic function .
For a short time , she seemed &quot; locked in &quot; .
She has made slow progress since then and at the time of discharge has 4-strength at the left elbow and 4+ in the left wrist and hand .
Trace movement of the right elbow and 4-strength of the right wrist and hand .
4-to 4+ strength at the left ankle , 4+ strength at the right knee and right ankle .
She is unable to lift either foot off the bed .
The extra ocular movements are full .
Tongue protrudes 4 cm .
She is drowsy at times , but generally alert , responsive , interactive , able to talk in two to three word sentences when she wants to .
She has severe memory deficits , but nevertheless , is able to engage in conversation , answers questions , names things well , does calculations and recognizes family members and states preferences .
She has been working with Speech Therapy , occupational therapy and physical therapy closely and should continue to show improvement .
She is anticoagulated on Coumadin and this has been stable .
She is do not resuscitate in agreement with the wishes of her multiple family members .
Follow up computerized tomography scans and magnetic resonance imaging studies have shown infarction in bilateral basis pontis , mid brain , the superior cerebellar areas , left thalamus , bilateral temporal lobes medially and inferiorly and left posterior communicating artery .
The patient had fevers sporadically during this hospitalization with rising white blood counts .
A chest X-ray documented a progressing left lower lobe infiltrate .
Initially this improved on Clindamycin and Cefotetan , but fevers recurred on this antibiotic regimen .
Sputum grew out Klebsiella pneumoniae , and she was treated with Gentamicin and Ancef for 14 days intravenous ( bug being sensitive to these two drugs ) .
A left pleural effusion developed and this was tapped with ultrasound guidance , and found to be sterile , and without evidence of empyema .
The patient is on Ciprofloxacin .
The day of discharge is day #3 of 7 , after which antibiotics should be totally discontinued .
She has developed bad thrush in this setting , she is not yet able to swallow and so she is on Nystatin swish and spit five times a day .
She also gets Peridex to clean out her mouth .
Once her liver enzymes are completely normal , a seven day course of Fluconazol may be helpful if the thrush is not spontaneously resolving off of antibiotics .
She has been afebrile for greater than 10 days , including several days on oral antibiotics .
The patient &apos;s liver enzymes were noted to be elevated mid way through her hospital course , to about three times normal , especially the SGOT and SGPT .
These have spontaneously reversed , and are nearly normal at the time of discharge .
A right upper quadrant ultrasound documented gallstones , without evidence of common bile duct dilatation or active cholecystitis .
The exact cause of her liver enzyme elevation is unclear , but we are being careful about administering drugs , which might irritate the liver .
The patient had a steady decline in her hematocrit during this hospitalization .
Iron studies are all entirely normal , her anemia is attributed to anemia or chronic disease with hypoproliferation as well as multiple phlebotomies .
The plan is to give her folic acid , but not iron .
The patient &apos;s potassiums have been repeatedly low and require daily checks and repletion .
This is thought due to the extensive course of Gentamicin which she received .
This must be carefully checked despite the standing order for potassium .
The patient has had low sodiums during this hospitalization .
This may due to her central nervous system process or her pulmonary process , with fluids administered as described , she should not have any problems from this .
Her sodiums were never below 130 .
She does well with tube feeds .
Her tube feeds orders are as follow :
full strength Replete with fiber at 70 cc. per hour .
In addition , the patient gets 250 cc. of juice ( not water ) three times a day .
She also gets Lactinex granules three packages in each bottle of tube feeds .
She also gets Metamucil one teaspoon with the first bolus of juice each day .
Please note that evaluation by the swallowing therapist , showed that the patient is aspirating at this time , but there is great hope from the nature of her deficit and the good movements of her tongue that normal swallowing should return soon .
It is for this reason that she is discharged with an nasogastric tube and that no plans for G tube placement are made at this time .
She has a history of of angina without myocardial infarction that has not been worked up .
She did have brief chest pain twice during this admission that did not correlate with electrocardiogram changes .
In the first week of November , her electrocardiogram showed T wave inversions in the lateral leads , correlating with an increase in the LDH , but not CK .
This did not normalize with administration of Isordil and the patient denied chest pain at this time .
As of 4/7 , her electrocardiogram had reverted back to normal and there is no evidence of congestive heart failure or continued electrocardiogram changes , and chest pain is absent .
Her cholesterol was 350 here .
She has been off of her hypercholesterol medicines .
These can be restarted when it is deemed reasonable , in view of her acute disease and recently elevated liver enzymes .
Note that the liver enzymes were normal on admission , at which time she was taking all of the above cholesterol medicines .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
Metamucil 1 teaspoon q.d. , with first bolus of juice , juice 250 cc. down nasogastric tube t.i.d. , tube feeds as above , Lactinex as above , Tagamet 800 mg. nasogastric tube qhs , Nystatin swish and spit 10 cc. five times a day , Cardizem slow release 90 mg.

She does have a history of peripheral edema on Dyazide .
She has been a smoker and presented on the day of admission with dizziness .
She was in her usual state of health until two to three days prior to admission when she noted intermittent dizziness and felt weak .
She denied chest pain , shortness of breath , nausea or vomiting .
On the morning of admission to the Haold Memorial Hospital she went out to feed some birds and then felt weak , came back , was dizzy and was somewhat diaphoretic .
Her sister with whom she lives insisted that she seek medical care and she was brought to the Haold Memorial Hospital emergency room and was found to have a pulse of 61 and blood pressure of 91/45 .
The electrocardiogram done there showed evidence of an inferior wall infarction with ST segment elevations in leads 2 , 3 and AVF and ST depressions in leads V1 through V4 and AVL .
Right sided leads did not provide evidence of a right ventricular infarction .
She was given Streptokinase , aspirin , Dopamine for hypotension and Atropine with external Zoll pacemaker after bradycardia into the 30 &apos;s developed .
The blood sugar was elevated at 208 .
The BUN was 24 and creatinine 1.7 .
The uric acid 11.2 and initial CK was 35 .
When she developed wide complex tachycardia she was given a Lidocaine bolus and brought to the FIH by helicopter .
In the emergency room she appeared hemodynamically stable initially and the Dopamine was weaned off .
The electrocardiogram taken here showed the ST segment elevations had diminished considerably but there were continued reciprocal changes in the anterior leads .
She had a few beats of wide complex tachycardia .
Her only medication was Dyazide .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
She was a pleasant rather vague obese woman in no acute distress .
The pulse was 68 to 80 and the blood pressure 95/52 .
The respirations 18 and she was afebrile .
The jugular veins were not distended .
The carotids were full .
There were no bruits .
The chest was clear with distant breath sounds .
The cardiac rhythm was regular with frequent premature beats and no murmur .
There were no rubs .
The abdomen was obese without palpable organs or masses .
There was no peripheral edema .
There were good dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis pulses bilaterally .
There was decreased vibratory sense on neurological examination but there was no asterixis .
Her electrolytes were normal with a BUN of 24 and creatinine 1.9 .
The cholesterol was 171 .
Triglycerides 103 .
By this time her CK was 600 .
Her hematocrit was 37.1 .
Hemoglobin 12.8 and white blood count 7800 .
The PT was 19.3 and PTT 34.8 .
Review of the electrocardiograms from Haold Memorial Hospital demonstrated atrial flutter with variable conduction .
She was in sinus tachycardia here with right bundle branch block and continued ST segment elevation with Qs in 3 and AVF .
She was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit where she continued to have intermittent marked bradycardia with junctional rhythm and relatively low blood pressures and runs of flow ventricular tachycardia .
She became increasingly disoriented .
She developed first degree AV block and then Wenckebach block .
The chest films showed mild cephalization .
She became very drowsy with sedation when she developed some agitation and required intubation .
She went to the cardiac catheterization laboratory because of low cardiac output and shock .
She had ventricular pacing and the cardiac output came up to 2.3 .
Catheter study then revealed right coronary occlusion with no significant left sided disease .
The right coronary artery had a large burden of intravascular thrombus and she was eventually able to have the clot cleared and a near 2.5 stent was placed with good result .
She had TIMI 2 to 3 flow in the right coronary artery after stenting and removal of clot from the right coronary artery .
She continued to have intermittent runs of ventricular tachycardia .
She remained intubated but her hemodynamics improved somewhat .
Dobutamine was diminished because of the wide complex tachycardia and she developed atrial fibrillation .
She was initially tried on intravenous Pronestyl in an attempt to restore sinus rhythm .
She was later switched to Amiodarone but there continued to be no effect on her atrial fibrillation .
Eventually her lines were able to be withdrawn and she was moved to the floor .
She had a lot of wheezing and in late January she had continued elevated wedge pressure and her creatinine started to rise to 3.2 and then 4 with nonoliguric renal failure .
She was then returned to the Unit where she underwent further monitoring .
The BUN rose to 91 .
Her Digoxin level was 1.9 on February 6 .
She was able eventually to be extubated and moved back to the floor .
Efforts to mobilize her began in early January and an echocardiogram demonstrated an ejection fraction of 49% .
The right ventricular function was normal .
After extubation she developed a considerable amount of upper respiratory stridor which was treated initially with Decadron .
The patient was seen in consultation by ENT consultants who found that she had some hardened inspissated secretions in the region of the vocal cords , glottic inlet and subglottis .
There was no structural abnormality .
Moistened oxygen and Mucomyst was given with eventual restoration of her voice and diminution in her stridor .
She continued a rather slow improvement .
The patient was seen in consultation by Drs. Morning and Morning because of the abnormalities of renal function .
The possibility of renal artery stenosis was raised and she eventually was able to have a MRI .
She had some hematuria and was seen by Dr. Ryna Jescdrig .
Renal and bladder ultrasounds were normal .
She had abnormal urinary cytology however and Dr. Jescdrig strongly recommended that this be followed up by cystoscopy when she is able to do that .
That can take place either here at his office or in Aersing Rocuch Sun or when she returns to Carfachemoses Hospital .
Because of alternating and fluctuating mental status , she had a head CT scan which showed small area of intracranial bleeding .
This was followed up and was shown to resolve .
MR angiogram revealed no evidence of renal artery stenosis .
A MRI of the head because of the small area of bleeding was done to look for amyloid angiopathy which would have made anticoagulation dangerous .
She was then begun on Coumadin when none was found and is now being transferred to rehabilitation in hopes of her eventual return to her home with her sister on Carfachemoses Hospital .

Report Status :
Signed
Discharge Date :
05/28/1992
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES :
1. Carotid stenosis .
2. Aortic stenosis .
3. Coronary artery disease .
PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 76-year-old female who was admitted to the medicine service on 04-29-92 with a past history significant for aortic stenosis and chest pain who presented for evaluation for aortic valve replace-ment .
The patient has a history of exertional angina and chest pain associated with light-headedness for nine years which was noted to increase in frequency over the past year , then upon admission had light-headedness and chest pain with a dull pressure in her neck to her substernal area , with only minimal exertion such as &quot; walking across the room &quot; .
She states this light-headedness is often associated with shortness of breath and diaphoresis occasionally with nausea .
She denies any vomiting , states that the episodes usually last about five minutes and are relieved with rest .
The pain and light-headedness is now severely lifestyle limiting and the patient requested evaluation for possible aortic valve replacement .
Cardiac risk factors hypercholesterolemia , hypertension , no history of tobacco use , diabetes or family history .
Past medical history is as stated above , aortic stenosis , found to be critical on echocardiogram on 4-13-92 , done in Otte A , New Jersey and was found to have left ventricular hypertrophy and ejection fraction of 58% , no right heart wall motion abnormali-ties and an aortic valve gradient of greater than 100 .
She also has a history of uterine fibroids , status post total abdominal hysterectomy .
She has known bilateral carotid disease , stated to be greater than 70% bilaterally .
She has a history of glaucoma and a questionable history of claudication in her legs as well as a history of hypertension .
Medications on admission were only aspirin p.r.n. and Timoptic solution 0.5% to the left eye twice a day .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On physical examination she was afebrile with a blood pressure of 170/100 , heart rate of 70 .
HEENT examination notable for bilateral arcussenilis but otherwise unremarkable .
Her neck showed no JVD , there was a slow carotid upstroke bilaterally , there were bilateral carotid bruits versus transmitted murmur .
Chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally .
Cardiac examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm with a normal S1 and S2 , 3/6 systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border , no gallop was detected .
Her abdomen was soft , nontender with good bowel sounds .
Extremi-ties :
There is no clubbing , cyanosis or edema and her peripheral pulses were trace palpable .
LAB / X-RAY DATA :
Labs on admission :
Sodium 141 , potassium 5.0 , BUN 18 , creatinine 1.0 , PT 12.3 , PTT 24 , WBC 7.6 , hematocrit 41 , platelets 278,000 .
EKG revealed a normal sinus rhythm with a rate of 69 , left ventricular hyper-trophy with poor anterior progression of R-waves .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
She was admitted and evaluated by the cardiac surgery service after having undergone cardiac catheterization which revealed a 70% stenosis of her left circumflex artery , 50% stenosis of the left anterior descending and 10% stenosis of the right coronary artery .
Carotid angiography revealed left internal carotid stenosis of 90% , right internal carotid artery &quot; critical stenosis &quot; .
On 05-01-92 she was taken to the operating room at which time she underwent an aortic valve replacement with a # 19 St. Jude valve , coronary artery bypass graft times one with saphenous vein graft from the posterior descending artery to the obtuse marginal and right carotid endarterectomy .
This was performed by Dr. Medicine and Dr. Room .
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was found postoperatively to have some left upper extremity weakness on proximal greater than distal musculature .
She was extubated on postoperative day number one and otherwise had an unremarkable postoperative course with the exception of her left upper extremity weakness .
On 05-04-92 she was evaluated by the neurology service , who recommended a CT scan , however no evidence of infarction was detected .
There was only diffuse small vessel disease noted .
On 05-05-92 she was noted to convert to atrial fibrillation which resolved spontaneously a few days later .
However , on 05-07-92 there was a a question of a new event with addition to the left upper extremity weakness , some noted right upper and right lower extremity discoordination .
She was begun on a heparin drip .
On 5-9-92 the right-sided symptoms worsened and she also had some elements of aphasia .
She underwent angiography on 5-9-92 which showed the right internal carotid artery to be patent , however there was highly significant stenosis of the left carotid artery and she was taken to the operating room later that day for a left carotid endarterectomy .
She was taken postoperatively the ICU where she was extubated on postoperative day number one and by 5-11-92 she was noted to have markedly increased use of her right side , resolving aphasia and she was transferred to the floor with the residual deficit only noted to be some left upper extremity weakness .
She was worked up aggressively with the physical therapy and occupational services , made good progress and began ambulating with assistance with a walker but with minimal assistance from an aid .
She was feeding herself and was very enthusiastic and energetic in her participation in her rehabilitation activities .
She was maintained on heparin therapy initially but this was quickly switched over to Coumadin anticoagulation therapy which she will need to be on long-term for her aortic valve replacement .
DISPOSITION :
She is transferred to Rockdempbanri Hospital on 05-28-92 to continue her rehabilitation .
Discharge medications :
Lopressor 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. ; Nifedipine 10 mg p.o. t.i.d. ; Timoptic solution 0.5% OS b.i.d. ; Coumadin 1 mg alternating with 1.5 mg q.o.d. at q.h.s. and Haldol 2 mg p.o. q.h.s. p.r.n. in the evening , only for agitation associated with confusion .
Upon discharge it was the recommendation of the cardiology team that the patient &apos;s prothrombin time be monitored weekly and be kept at a ratio of 3-4 IU .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a 70-year-old woman with a history of end-stage renal disease , on hemodialysis and peritoneal hemodialysis for ten years , transferred from Ton University Hospital for further evaluation of change in mental status .
She was admitted to Aper Hospital for change in mental status on 7/19/2002 .
Initial work up was unrevealing .
She was discharged to rehabilitation and developed disorientation , confusion , incoordination , and apparent paranoia .
She was diagnosis with a urinary tract infection and perineal inflammation and was transferred to the hospital and treated with IV Tequin for urinary tract infection .
Throughout her admission , she experienced occasional low-grade temperatures to 99 Fahrenheit with persistent leukocytosis .
There was a reported examination of her peritoneal fluid when fluid was being drawn for culture .
A catheter was subsequently placed for treatment of __________ for three days of ceftazidime .
Herperitoneal fluid cultures have all been negative and showed only 3 polys .

She had decreased strength bilaterally .
She missed her nose with both hands when asked to touch her nose .
There was a questionable positive Babinski on the right side .
The toes were downgoing on the left .
She answered appropriately to yes-no questions , but _____________
She appeared to understand questions , but then could not come up with the answers , or where she was , and she could not give her name , but did respond when her name was used .
LABORATORY DATA :
On admission included a sodium of 146 , potassium 3.4 , chloride 101 , CO2 31.6 , BUN 8 , creatinine 4.3 , glucose 94 , calcium 10.5 , magnesium 1.5 , phosphorus 2.5 .
Her liver function tests were all within normal limits .
Her coagulation factors showed a PT of 13.2 , INR 1.2 , PTT 23.2 .
Her white blood cell count was elevated at 17.6 .
The hematocrit was 43.3 , platelets 425,000 .
The differential was 85% polymorphonuclearleukocytes .
Abdominal CT scan from the outside hospital showed no abscess and left renal atrophy with multiple cysts .
The electroencephalogram showed left greater than right frontotemporal slowing throughout the tracing .
Head CT scan on 07/30/2002 showed prominent ventricles , cortical atrophy , and suggested infarct in the left thalamus , left insular cortex , and decreased attenuation in the right frontal lobe .
As noted , laboratory data at the outside hospital included a negative Clostridium difficile , a weakly positive D-dimer , a weakly positive lupus anticoagulant , and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 48 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient &apos;s presentation was a very confusing and complicated one with differential diagnosis including a neurodegenerative process such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease , a dementia such as Alzheimer &apos;s of a more rapidly progressing nature , and other infectious etiologies such as urinary tract infection or another fever source .
Work up included from a neurologic perspective brain MRI , brain EEG , lumbar puncture .
In concert with the Neurology Service , who followed the patient with us , we ordered an EEG and MRI with susceptibilities and DWI .
An lumbar puncture was performed , in which we measured the opening pressure as unremarkable at 14.5 cm .
In addition , per Neurology recommendations , we sent cerebrospinal fluid for Gram stain , bacterial culture , fungal cultures , acid-fast bacilli , __________ antigen , 14-3-3 protein for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease , cytology , and , in addition , ordered EEGs , MRIs , antithyroglobulin antibody , antithyroid peroxidase antibody , TSH , ammonia , methyl malonic acid , and , in addition , considered neoplastic tests from the serum and the cerebrospinal fluid including anti-Ma , anti-Ta , anti-CV2 , anti-Hu , anti-yo antibodies .
In addition , from a renal perspective , the patient was placed on a Tuesday , Thursday , Saturday dialysis schedule .
For her hypertension , shewas given lisinopril .
For her FEN , the patient was able to take PO &apos;s and , per Speech and Swallow consult , was permitted to take PO &apos;s with one to one supervision .
For prophylaxis , the patient was on subcutaneous heparin and Nexium .
From an infectious disease perspective , the patient remained afebrile and , despite a transient bump in her white blood cell count over the weekend of 08/10 through 08/12/2002 , has had a white blood cell count come back to normal range of 12.0 .
No obvious source of infection was found , with negative cultures from blood , urine , sputum , the peritoneal fluid , and cerebrospinal fluid .
Excellent suggestions from Dr. Pa of the Renal Service included repeating anticardiolipin and lupus anticoagulant , given the patient &apos;s weakly positive lupus anticoagulant in the past and the fact that this could be associated with severe and rapid cognitive decline that was observed in this patient .
However , these antibodies were both within normal limits .
The patient &apos;s mental status gradually began to improve during the course ofthe weekend from 08/10 through 08/12 and was markedly improved on 08/13/2002 , compared with the day of admission .
However , the patient remains not oriented to time or to place , although she is now able to answer questions and actually carry on simple conversations appropriately .
The nature of her cognitive decline and change in mental status is still unclear , with most typical and less typical causes of reversible change in mental status having been ruled out and no obvious sources of infection from blood , CSF , sputum , urine , or peritoneal fluid .
On the abdominal CT scan , there was a question of an ovarian cystic mass that raised the possibility of ovarian cancer .
CA-125 levels were within normal limits .
We entertained the possibility of doing a pelvic ultrasound to further characterize this lesion .
We will discuss the case further with the Neurology Service , who will evaluate the case more carefully tomorrow with their attending .
Pending no further suggestions on their part , we have completed the metabolic work up for reversible causes of dementia and will likely discharge the patient to return to the Termarimed pending no further suggestions from Neurology or other consultants .

Admission white blood count 4.3 , hematocrit 31.0 , electrolytes were all within normal limits , glucose 218 , prothrombin time on admission was 15.1 with INR of 1.5 , partial thromboplastin time 23.3 .
The electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation with slow ventricular response and digitalis effect as well as left ventricular hypertrophy .
IMPRESSION ON ADMISSION :
Impression was that this was an 83-year-old female with cardiac history , dyspnea on exertion , increased calcium and hyperparathyroidism who presents for parathyroidectomy .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
On the day of admission , the patient was brought to the operating room for parathyroidectomy .
The right superior parathyroid gland was found to be markedly enlarged and consistent with an adenoma .
Her right superior parathyroid gland was removed and the rest of her parathyroid glands were left in place .
Postoperatively , the patient did well and was able to cough and phonate completely with no changes from preoperative .
The plan was to start her on heparin and Coumadin and discontinue her heparin when her Coumadin levels became therapeutic as judged by the prothrombin time / INR .
However , on postoperative day number two , the patient in the afternoon noticed some tingling in her hands and also some tingling hear her perioral region .
She had a negative Chvostek &apos;s and negative Trousseau &apos;s sign .
She had no muscular weakness noted .
An ionized calcium was drawn which was low at 1.0 .
As a result , the patient was started on Os-Cal 250 mg PO q.i.d. On postoperative day number three , her ionized calcium was 1.06 and her Os-Cal was increased to 500 q.i.d.
However , her ionized calcium decreased to 0.97 and she was given one amp of calcium gluconate .
On postoperative day number five , the patient felt fine and had an INR of 1.9 with a prothrombin time of 16.6 .
Her calcium was 8.5 , albumin 3.6 , and phosphate 4.5 .
She had had no further episodes of tingling in her fingers after the initial episode which had prompted us originally to draw the ionized calcium .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
Good .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
1. Coumadin 5 mg PO q.day , then she will follow up with her primary care physician and decide the dosage thereafter ,
2. Lopid 600 mg PO b.i.d. ,
3. K-Dur 20 mg PO q.day ,
4. Os-Cal 500 mg PO q.i.d. ,
5. Rocaltrol 0.25 mg PO b.i.d. ,
6. Lasix 40 mg PO q.day ,
7. Norvasc 5 mg PO q.day ,
8. Digoxin .25 mg PO q.day ,
9. Lopressor 50 mg PO b.i.d. ,
10. Glucotrol 10 mg qam .
FOLLOW UP :
For follow up , the patient is to call for an appointment with Dr. Sapmal .
In addition , she is to follow up with her primary care physician to check her prothrombin time / INR as well as calcium , albumin and phosphate levels .
She will be sent home with home Arnsperni Health .

She was diagnosed in 1991 during the birth of her child .
She claims she does not know why she is HIV positive .
She is from Maryland , apparently had no blood transfusions before the birth of her children so it is presumed heterosexual transmission .
At that time , she also had cat scratch fever and she had resection of an abscess in the left lower extremity .
She has not used any anti retroviral therapy since then , because of pancytopenia and vomiting on DDI .

CHIEF COMPLAINT :
Cean Leach is a 38 year old male who is admitted in transfer from the Morehegron Valley Hospital in Ville , Virginia for further evaluation and management of accelerating chest pains syndrome .
Mr. Leach has a long and complex history of coronary artery disease .
He was without known cardiovascular illness until he suffered an acute anterior myocardial infarction in August of l988 .
He was treated at that time with TPA .
A subsequent cardiac catheterization revealed a 90% lesion in his proximal left anterior descending coronary artery and minor disease elsewhere in his coronary distribution .
His ejection fraction was in the mid-50&apos;s.
Because of angina following that catheterization , he ultimately underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of his left anterior descending coronary artery .
He did well until he developed recurrent angina in March of l991 at which time repeat catheterization demonstrated restenosis of his left anterior descending and he underwent a second PTCA with good results .
He again did well until approximately late l992 .
Since that time , he has had multiple admissions to George&apos;sdgot Medical Center with recurrent chest pain .
He has ruled in for small R Q wave myocardial infarctions on many but not all of these occasions .
He has had a progressive decline in his left ventricular ejection fraction as measured by non-invasive means with an echo ejection fraction in the low 40&apos;s and radionuclide ejection fraction estimated in August of l994 at 31% .
He was admitted to George&apos;sdgot Medical Center with a typical episode of this discomfort in October of l994 .
He was transferred at that time to the Ph University Of Medical Center .
That was his first Ph University Of Medical Center admission .
Because of Mr. Leach &apos;s history and the fact that multiple cardiac catheterizations prior to that transfer had failed to demonstrate fixed epicardial coronary disease , it was decided that he should undergo provocative testing to evaluate whether or not he had coronary artery spasm and / or impaired coronary flow reserve .
His angiograms from Morehegron Valley Hospital from his four prior catheterizations were reviewed and the patient was gradually tapered off all of his vasoactive medications .
He was taken to the Catheter Laboratory on October 13 , 1994 .
There he had a right heart catheterization with unremarkable intercardiac pressures .
Repeat coronary angiography once again failed to demonstrate any significant obstructive lesions in either his dominant right coronary artery or his left coronary system .
He then underwent a Doppler Coronary Flow study which demonstrated impaired coronary flow reserve .
Specifically , his coronary flow maximally increased by a factor of 2-2.5 whereas a normal response is considered to a 3-4 fold increasing in coronary flow to maximal stimulus .
Following the coronary flow studies , he was given greater doses of intracoronary ergonovine to assess his susceptibility to coronary artery spasm .
He had a normal response to ergonovine that is he had diffuse narrowing of his coronary arteries without induction of focal spasm .
However , he did develop typical anginal discomfort which was easily reversed with intracoronary nitroglycerin .
It was felt that the time that this study was most consistent with a syndrome of impaired coronary flow reserve or microvascular angina .
He was treated with increasing doses of two calcium channel blockers and gradually ambulated in the hall without discomfort and was discharged to home .
Following that admission in October he had a symptom free interval which lasted a couple of months .
Starting in the October of l994 , he once again started having recurrences of his typical anginal discomfort .
This occurred at rest and with exercise .
He had multiple admissions to the Morehegron Valley Hospital once again ruling in for a small R Q wave myocardial infarctions on a number of these occasions .
His medications were adjusted many times without adequate interruption of the pattern of increasingly frequent and increasingly severe episodes of pain .
His most recent admission to the Morehegron Valley Hospital is on April 5 , of 1994 .
He had a prolonged episode of typical anginal pain and rule in for a small Q wave myocardial infarction .
Because of the refractory nature of his chest pain and the failure of multiple drug combinations to control his symptoms , he was transferred to Ph University Of Medical Center on 4-9-94 .
His medications that had been used individually or in combination include beta blockers and Lodapine cardiazem , nifidepine and coumadin , aspirin , cyclopadine and seratonin antagonists .
There is no history of drug abuse or smoking .
Of note , his brother had a myocardial infarction in his late 20&apos;s .
There is no other family history of premature coronary disease or history of stroke or deep venous thrombosis suggestive of hypercoaguable state .
Of note , his prior work-up has also included screening test for hypercoaguability with normal levels of protein S and C and an unrevealing right ventricular under myocardial biopsy .
His medications on admission included Isordil , Lovastatin , aspirin , heparin and Lodapine , Cardizem and Lasix .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
He looked generally well .
His blood pressure l60/90 .
His heart rate was 88 .
His jugular venous pressure was normal .
His chest was clear and his carotids were brisk and his cardiac examination revealed a soft systolic flow murmur .
His abdomen was obese with no palpable organomegaly .
His femoral pulses were l+ and equal without bruits .
He had trace peripheral edema and excellent peripheral pulses .
His initial laboratory values included a sodium of l38 .
Potassium of 3.2 .
Normal chloride and CO2 .
His BUN was 12 and his creatinine was 1.1 .
Glucose was l55 although subsequent determinations were normal .
His fasting cholesterol was 174 with an HDL of 35 and an LDH of 97 .
His liver function tests were normal with the exception of his LDH which was mildly elevated to 222 .
His hematocrit was approximately 39 with an unremarkable differential and normal platelet count .
His sedimentation rate was 32 and was 40 on repeat testing .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
the primary concern upon Mr. Leach &apos;s transfer was that despite the fact that he had multiple previous catheterizations over the prior two years that he may have redeveloped obstructive coronary artery disease .
It was ; therefore , felt appropriate to start his repeat work-up by repeating his cardiac catheterization and coronary angiography .
To that end , he was taken to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory on 4-10-94 , there he underwent right and left heart catheterization , coronary angiography and left ventriculography .
The right heart catheter which was done using a Swanz Ganz catheter advanced to 8 French sheath and right femoral vein revealed a mean right atrial pressure 3 mm of mercury and a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 12 mm of mercury .
The left ventricular pressure was l05/12 .
Coronary angiography revealed a picture which was essentially unchanged from October of l994 .
That is there was no obstructive large vessel or coronary artery disease although there were some diffuse luminal irregularities .
Left ventriculography revealed a large area of antero lateral and apical hypokinesis to akinesis with an estimated ejection fraction of 35% .
Impression at the time of his catheterization was that the precise etiology of his chest pain remained rather enigmatic .
He was ; therefore , seen in consultation by Dr. Lato Tikfreierm of the Hematology Service to evaluate him further for a possible hypocoagulable condition versus primary and secondary platelet abnormality which could explain his recurrent coronary events .
After an extensive evaluation including in vitro testing and flow cytometry of Mr. Leach &apos;s platelets , it was ultimately determined that he did in fact have a primary platelet defect .
Specifically , his platelets were not affected by aspirin and showed spontaneous hyperaggragability .
This was utilized in making some changes in Mr. Leach &apos;s regiment .
Specifically his aspirin was discontinued and he was put back on ticlopidine at a higher than ordinary dose at 500 mg. b.i.d.
Repeat in vitro testing of Mr. Leach &apos;s platelets suggested that although they remained refractory to aspirin , they did demonstrate reduced hyperaggragability spontaneously which was felt to be possible reflective of the ticlopidine effect .
While in the hospital , Mr. Leach continued to nearly daily episodes of chest pain .
These were generally spontaneous in nature and lasted anywhere from several minutes to nearly an hour duration .
There were typically improved but not completely eradicated with sublingual nitroglycerin and generally required i.v. narcotics for complete pain relief .
Because of the ongoing nature of his pain .
Multiple changes and additions were made to his drug regimen .
He was tried on theophylline and imipramine without real change in his chest pain syndrome .
He was tried on a variety of different combinations of calcium channel blockers including amlodipine and diltiazem and lodipine and verapamil .
Amlodipine and bepridil all without marked change in his clinical syndrome .
The rest of his hypercoagulable work-up revealed that he had nearly normal levels of clotting factors , specifically , his antithrombin 3 of level was lll with a reference range of 80-120 .
Protein C was 85 with a reference range of 70-140 .
Protein S was l14 with a reference range of 70-140 .
Plasminogen was slightly high at l51 with upper limit of normal being l30 .
Factor 8 was likewise slightly high at 249 with a reference range of 50-200 .
Thrombin time and repalase time were normal .
It was felt that these results were non-specific and may represent just an acute phase reactants .
His anti-cardio lipen antibodies both IGM and IGG were within normal range .
His APC resistance was normal .
He was seen in consultation by both Rheumatology and Endocrinology to evaluate the possibility of primary connective tissue disease an / or possible a theochromocytoma .
Rheumatology felt that there was no good evidence of a primary vasculitic process as the source of his presumed small vessell coronary disease and no further rheumatologic work-up was undertaken .
He had multiple 24 hour urine tests performed to evaluate the question of theochromocytoma , these demonstrated mild elevations of some urinary catacholomines , but it was felt that this could well represent a reaction to the complex medical regimen that he was having as well as the recurrent episodes of pain themselves .
It was not felt that he had good evidence of theochromocytoma .
His compliment levels were normal and he had no evidence of hepatitis , B serologies which also measured to see if there was some chronic inflammatory process .
Because of the persistent nature of his pain and the inability to control it adequately on constantly changing a quite complex medical regimen , it was suggested that a sympathetic blockade be performed as a method of controlling his chest pain syndrome .
To evaluate the efficacy of this prior to commiting him to a permanent blockade procedure , a temporary sympathetic blockade was performed using a local anesthetic and stellate ganglion injection .
Prior to performing that an exercise tolerance test was performed on May 13 .
That study demonstrated that the patient was able to exercise for ten minutes of a standard protocol and stopped because of fatigue ; although he had no significant ST changes with exercise , he did experience his typical anginal chest discomfort which was ultimately relieved of the combination of sublingual nitroglycerin and i.v. morphine sulfate .
On the basis of that test , he underwent stellate block the following day .
That was performed in the pain clinic using l% lidocaine to the skin and l0 cc of Bupivacaine under fluoroscopic guidance at the level of T1 .
This produced a good sympathetic block with evidence of a rise in temperature in the left arm and ptosis and myosis of the left eye .
He was then taken directly from the pain clinic to the exercise laboratory and repeat exercise testing was done .
He once again exercised for ten minutes achieved the same rate pressure product and had no chest discomfort .
This encouraged his care takers to pursue a more permanent sympathetic blockade .
After extended discussions with pain service , Mr. Leach was brought back down to the pain clinic on October 27 .
There a catheter was placed at the level of T1 under fluroscopic guidance .
Once again Narcaine was injected to induce a sympathetic block .
The catheter was left in place for approximately 24 hours with recurrent injections maintained the sympathetic block and during that time he had no recurrent angina .
After extensive discussions with the patient , the pain service and thoracic surgery , it was felt appropriate to proceed with a surgical sympathectomy to relieve him of his intractable chest pain syndrome .
Therefore , on October 27 , the patient underwent left thorascopic thoracic sympathectomy by Dr. Aalv Sctroi .
He tolerated that procedure well and had no recurrent anginal pain throughout the rest of his hospitalization .
He had incisional pain which was well-controlled with a combination of Percocet and morphine sulfate and progressively ambulated and was discharged to home in good condition free of recurrent angina on May 27 , 1995 .

LFTs were normal .
Cholesterol 252 .
Chest x-ray normal .
EKG was within normal limits .
UA was normal .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted with a history of syncope for cardiac evaluation .
She was taken to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory where a catheterization revealed an 80% mid-RCA stenosis , 80% mid-LAD lesion and an LVEF of approximately 80% .
It was felt that these lesions were unrelated to the patient &apos;s episode , and were unlikely to cause her significant distress .
On the following day , she was taken to electrophysiologic study .
During the study , the right bundle branch was hit by the catheter , inducing a right bundle branch block .
Following this , upon rapid atrial pacing at a rate of 120 , there was revealed a bifascicular left block , which combined with the right bundle branch block caused a complete heart block .
It was felt that given this rate-related block on the left , combined with the possibility of physiologic malfunction on the right , complete heart block as the source of the patient &apos;s syncopal episode was quite possible and plans were made to insert a VVI pacer .
The pacer was inserted on the fifth hospital day without event , and the patient was discharged home on the sixth hospital day .

LABORATORY DATA :
On admission the sodium was 144 , potassium 2.6 , chloride 114 , bicarbonate 12.3 , BUN 30 , creatinine 4.0 , glucose 89 .
The SGOT was 994 , LDH 1,888 , alkaline phosphatase 92 , total bilirubin 2.9 and direct bilirubin 11.2 .
Lactate was 6.3 , acetone negative , ammonia 26 , uric acids 26.9 , albumin 4.0 , globulin 3.0 , amylase 259 , lipase 34 , magnesium 3.5 , phosphorus 1.9 , calcium 9.4. The white blood count was 19.7 with 89% polys , 7% bands , 4% lymphs , with toxic granulations .
Hematocrit was 45.2 with a platelet count of 132,000 , falling rapidly to 24,000 .
The MCV is 88 .
The prothrombin time is 27.7 , partial thromboplastin time is greater than 100 .
The urinalysis revealed a specific gravity of 1.15 , pH 5.0 , and 4+ albumin , positive occult blood , with 0-5 granular casts and 5-10 RBCs and 3-5 WBCs .
The CK was 17,890 with 0.6% MB .
The urine sodium was 147 .
The serum toxicology was positive for Cocaine on admission to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital as well as the Sephsandpot Center .
The electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm at 85 with a prolonged QT at 0.572 .
An I-head CT revealed left sphenoid and left maxillary sinusitis with mild cerebral edema and no focal hemorrhages .
The abdominal CT revealed mesenteric adenopathy , normal bowels , hepatosplenomegaly , and ? fatty liver .
Chest x-ray revealed early interstitial edema .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted with the diagnosis of Cocaine induced rhabdomyolysis , renal failure , disseminated intravascular coagulation , shock , hepatic failure , pancreatitis , and thrombocytopenia in the setting of Cocaine intoxication .
He was accepted at the Vo Yd Burgsygu Hospital Center Intensive Care Unit and his hospital course will be reviewed by problems .
1-Rhabdomyolysis .
The patient had massive Cocaine induced rhabdomyolysis .
This resulted in tremendous third spacing of fluid and persistent intervascular hypovolemia .
The patient &apos;s creatinine ______________ kinase peaked at 56,160 with negative MB percentages .
The aldolase was positive at 142 .
This was further complicated by hypocalcemia which resulted in mild electrocardiographic abnormalities .
The patient &apos;s urine was alkalinized with intravenous bicarbonate to maximize the myoglobin secretion .
The patient &apos;s urine output was further augmented by adding Dopamine .
Nevertheless , the patient &apos;s renal failure continued to progress .
Over the course of the hospitalization his CK fell in the serum .
Much of his diffuse pain was felt to be due to this massive rhabdomyolysis .
2-Renal failure .
The creatinine was 4.4 on admission and peaked at 10.5 on the 15th .
The urinalysis revealed 4+ albumin with marked occult blood .
Peritoneal dialysis was instituted on 4/11 after a Tenckhoff catheter was placed by Drs. Freierm , Le , and Round .
Subsequently his creatinine rose for three days and then stabilized at 10 .
He continued to make minimal urine throughout the hospitalization .
3-Disseminated intravascular coagulation .
On admission the patient &apos;s prothrombin time was 27.7 with a partial thromboplastin time of greater than 100 and a d-dimer positive at 8 with a fibrinogen of 69 .
He went on to develop profound thrombocytopenia complicated by hemorrhage .
The patient was supported with abundant use of fresh frozen plasma , cryoprecipitate , platelets , and packed red blood cells .
His DIC was further complicated by hepatic failure which resulted in poor endogenous production of clotting factors and he remained fresh frozen plasma dependent .
4-Septic shock .
The patient remained pressor dependent throughout his hospitalization .
He was maintained variously on Levophed , Dobutamine , Dopamine , and ultimately Epinephrine for blood pressure support .
Hemodynamic monitoring revealed low systemic vascular resistance and high cardiac output .
He had multiple sources of infection including his sinuses , lungs , and multiple lines .
This will be discussed below .
Further he had massive muscle necrosis and hepatic failure .
An echocardiogram on 4/12 revealed a dilated left ventricle which was diffusely mildly hypokinetic with no vegetations .
His ejection fraction was 55% .
On 4/16 the pulmonary artery catheter was placed which revealed a wedge pressure of 8 , cardiac index of 4.5 , and an SVR of 5.8 .
5-Hepatic failure .
His SGPT on admission was 2,520 with a peak at 7,680 on hospital day two .
He had complete loss of synthetic and conjugation function of the liver with rising bilirubin and falling albumin with dependence on transfusion for support of his prothrombin time .
He was seen in consultation by the GI Service and the Liver Transplantation Service .
Given his multiple other medical problems , the direness of his situation , and his ongoing substance abuse at the time of admission he was deemed not to be a candidate for a liver transplantation .
6-Cocaine intoxication .
Serum Cocaine was positive 6-12 hours ingestion at the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital .
Further , at Ceanotsit Ortgold Center his serum toxicology screens were positive .
This is thought to be the insighting cause of his massive rhabdomyolysis and hepatic failure .
7-Pneumonia .
The patient developed two pneumonias with two separate organisms .
The first was Acinetobacter calcoaceticus subspecies anitratus , treated with Ciprofloxacin and Gentamicin .
He subsequently developed a staphylococcus aureus pneumonia which was treated with Vancomycin , dosed to levels appropriate for his renal failure .
He was seen in consultation by the Infectious Disease Service who advised us on antibiotic choices daily .
8-Pancreatitis .
The amylase on admission was 279 with a lipase of 161 .
Although not fully this may have contributed to his hypocalcemia and volume requirements .
9-Catheter tip infections .
The patient grew out coagulase negative staphylococcus from the femoral lines which were placed during his profound hypertension .
These were treated with Vancomycin .
10-Anemia .
The patient &apos;s hematocrit was 33% on admission and fell to 28 requiring 4 units of packed red blood cells over the course of his hospitalization .
11-Coma .
The patient , although initially minimally responsive , went on to develop a deep comatose state .
A CT scan on admission revealed no evidence of hemorrhage though he did have sphenoid sinusitis .
The lumbar puncture and sinus exploration were unable to be performed given the patient &apos;s persistent coagulopathy .
The patient was treated empirically with Nafcillin and Ceftriaxone for meningitis and sinusitis .
Further complicating this was his profound liver failure with rising ammonias and hepatic encephalopathy .
Despite maximal supports the patient continued to be hypotensive .
Mid-way through his hospital course he developed trilobar pneumonia and this was probably complicated further by adult respiratory distress syndrome and the multi-organ system failure syndrome .
The patient remained mechanically ventilated throughout his hospitalization .
Nevertheless , he developed refractory hypoxemia , hypotension , and ultimately the patient died despite total life support .

1/25/94 :
Urgent right carotid endarterectomy and coronary artery bypass graft .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 76 year old white female who was transferred from Oneoremadi Ryviewmawpa Greecounbci with severe coronary artery disease and presented for coronary artery bypass grafting .
The patient overall had been in her usual state of good health until three to four months prior when she developed progressively worsening chest pain exacerbated bystress .
In retrospect she has had several years of rare episodes of chest pain attributed to indigestion .
On 01/14/94 she underwent a Persantine-thallium test at Lichampm Kane Ancester Medical Center which showed anterolateralischemia and she also developed chest pain during her study .
She was admitted for cardiac catheterization which on transfer today showed severe left main disease with occluded right coronary artery and 95 percent stenosis of the circumflex with severe proximal left anterior descending .
She was transferred to TGCHO for surgical evaluation and was stable throughout except for some chest pain during her cardiac catheterization relieved with morphine and intravenous nitroglycerin .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Is above above , as well as ( 2 ) non-insulin diabetes mellitus which she is controlled on oral hypoglycemics , and ( 3 ) hypertension .
ALLERGIES :
None .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Tenormin 25 mg b.i.d. , Vasotec 10 mg q.d. , Diabinase 250 mg b.i.d. , nitroglycerin paste to chest wall , enteric coated aspirin one tablet PO q.d. , heparin intravenously , Dyazide 1 tablet PO q.d.
SOCIAL HISTORY :
No alcohol use and quit tobacco greater than 25 years ago with a 10-pack year smoking history .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The vital signs were stable .
She was a pleasant obese white female in no acute distress .
HEENT examination was within normal limits ; neck was without adenopathy , lungs were clear to auscultation and percussion ; heart regular rate and rhythm with distant heart sounds .
Abdomen was benign .
Extremities :
without deformities or varicosities .
Vascular showed 2 plus pulses except for her dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses which were one plus .
She had a left carotid bruit .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Given the patient &apos;s severe three vessel coronary artery disease a Cardiac Surgery consult was obtained for possible coronary artery bypass grafting .
She was kept on intravenous heparin , nitroglycerin and beta blockade .
Regarding her carotid bruit a carotid non-invasive study was obtained which showed severe right internal carotid artery stenosis and moderate left internal carotid artery stenosis .
In conjunction with the cardiac surgeons Dr. Ausguall from the Vascular Surgery Service was consulted for carotid endarterectomy on the right .
In anticipation of her endarterectomy she underwent an MRA angiogram on 01/22/94 .
Results of the angiogram showed that she right internal carotid artery stenosis with some hemodynamic effect in the distal LCA lumen diameter .
Due to this result an urgent carotid endarterectomy along with her coronary artery bypass graft was performed on 1/25/94 .
There were no complications and postoperatively she was transferred to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit in stable condition .
She remained neurologically intact and did well from the Vascular Surgery stand point .
Her Intensive Care Unit stay was only notable for an increase in chest tube output which subsequently decreased and was removed prior to her transfer to the floor .
She had some ectopy , specifically frequent ectopic activity after her surgery for which a Cardiac Arrhythmia Service consult was obtained and she was put on a Holter monitor and echocardiogram was obtained .
She remained hemodynamically stable and wires were kept intact beyond postoperative day four since she had some evidence of heart block .
Her beta blocker was held and she continued to be in sinus rhythm versus atrial fibrillation with frequent premature ventricular contractions .
Echocardiogram revealed her left ventricle to be within normal limits and otherwise her study was negative .
Holter monitor results were pending at the time of discharge .
Wires were subsequently discontinued and her digoxin and beta blocker were discontinued .
Otherwise her hospital course was uneventful .
She tolerated a regular diet , wounds remained clean , dry and intact and she was transferred to Villtionnca Hospital on 2/2/94 .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
Stable and afebrile .

1. Cardiovascular :
The patient was found to be in congestive heart failure and thought likely secondary to diastolic dysfunction secondary to hypertension .
The patient was also found to have pulmonary hypertension .
She ruled out for myocardial infarction with 3 negative enzymes .
On admission , she was diuresed with Lasix and was negative 1-2 liters per day for several days .
The diuresis was backed off when her bicarbonate increased from 36 to 39 .
She was restarted on 20 mg p.o. q day prior to discharge .

She has episodes of not breathing .
BIPAP was attempted for 3 nights in a row and the patient did not tolerate this .
She will need pulmonary function studies as an outpatient as these were not done in the hospital .
The pulmonary team saw the patient and only recommended the above testing .
She needs home oxygen and is currently at 2 liters nasal cannula oxygen .
3. Infectious disease :
Evidence for cellulitis on her legs , likely due to distention from edema and poor perfusion .
She was originally started on cefazolin which was then changed to Keflex with good improvement .
She will need to continue for at least 10 more days or as clinically indicated by the course of her cellulitis .
4. Hematology :
D-dimer in the emergency room was greater than 1000 and a right common femoral clot was seen .
This clot was small and it was questionable as to whether it was old or new .
She was started on anticoagulation given the positive D-dimer .
Chest CT was nondiagnostic but did not show pulmonary embolus .
It was a poor study .
Heparin was maintained during her hospital course and then Lovenox was started .
Her dose was increased to 7.5 mg q day the day prior to discharge .
She will be discharged on this dose in addition to 1 day of Lovenox .
Discharge INR 1.8 .
Goal INR is 2.0-3.0 .
5. Fluids / electrolytes / nutrition :
Low salt diet .
Low cholesterol , low fat diet .
DISPOSITION ON DISCHARGE :
To rehabilitation .
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS :

RADIOLOGIC STUDIES :
Chest x-ray 10/10/97 :
Elevated left hemidiaphragm of uncertain etiology or duration .
Postoperative changes of the sternum and media stinum were seen and no acute pulmonary disease was visualized .
The patient also had a shoulder film done on 10/10/97 that showed a severely comminuted fracture of the proximal left humerus with proximal distraction .
A lucency and irregularity of the glenoid , possibly representing a fracture , was also seen , and a CT scan was therefore obtained in order to evaluate this area .
This CT scan , done also on 10/10/97 , again showed the severely comminuted fracture of the proximal left humerus .
Two major fracture fragments were seen at the humeral head , articulating with the glenoid fossa .
The fracture fragments retained their proper site of articulation with the glenoid fossa .
Innumerable smaller fracture fragments were interposed between the fracture fragment and the distal humeral shaft .
The glenoid fossa was intact .
No scapular fractures were present .
EKG :
normal sinus rhythm at 72 beats / minute , intraventricular conduction delay , Q - waves seen in II , III , and AVF with probable old inferior myocardial infarction .
T - waves were also noted to be inverted in I and AVL .
Ventricular bigeminy was also seen .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
1. ORTHOPEDICS :
The patient has a severely comminuted fracture of the proximal left humerus .
He is status post a hemiarthroplasty on 10/17/97 .
He received Ancef preoperatively .
Physical Therapy has been seeing the patient and putting him through passive external rotation to the neutral position of the left shoulder and forward flexion with physical therapy assistance .
Brittle bones were noted during the operation .
A bone density scan would be recommended as an outpatient , in order to evaluate this .
2. NEUROLOGICAL :
The patient has right facial droop , right ptosis , stable and present for greater than one year .
3. CARDIOVASCULAR :
No chest pain , no shortness of breath , 1+ ankle edema .
The patient was ruled out for a myocardial infarction , given his fall at the airport and bigeminy seen on electrocardiogram that he developed during conscious sedation during reduction of the fracture .
Cardiology was consulted and aspirin and beta blocker added to his regimen , as well as chest wall nitroglycerin around the time of surgery , which was subsequently discontinued .
An adenosine SESTAMIBI was performed on 10/12/97 , which showed a negative electrocardiogram for ischemia and cardiac perfusion scans , with a moderate-sized , dense , fixed inferior defect indicative of scar .
A small / moderate-sized , mild-intensity , reversible posterior lateral defect was also seen , indicative of mild / moderate ischemia .
An echocardiogram was performed on Columbus Day which showed an ejection fraction of 50% , left atrial enlargement , thickening of the aortic wall consistent with atherosclerotic changes , left ventricle size , and systolic function within normal limits .
Cardiac monitor was placed on the patient , given the bigeminy , and he did rule out for myocardial infarction .
Cardiology recommended that in addition to the medications already stated above , his hematocrit be kept greater than 30 .
After his procedure on 10/17/97 , elevated CPKs were noted on 10/19/97 to 10/20/97 , and the first level was 744 , CPK # 2 635 , and CPK # 3 461 .
MB fractionations of the CPKs were all negative and were thought to be secondary to the patient &apos;s beginning physical therapy on 10/19/97 , and all muscular in origin .
4. GASTROENTEROLOGY :
GI was consulted on 10/15/97 for melena , decreased hematocrit prior to his humeral fixation surgery .
Upper endoscopy x 2 were done .
The first was on 10/15/97 , which showed clotted blood in the esophagus .
The stomach had evidence of prior surgery and old blood in the stomach .
It was thought that the blood in the esophagus was secondary to a possible Mallory-Weiss tear .
A second endoscopy was also performed several days later , in order to rule out a gastric ulcer , and also because the patient had had another episode of melena .
A gastric ulcer was found and this was biopsied and pathology is pending at this time .
This report needs to be followed up , and will be available at Bri Health in the Pathology Department some time within the next three to seven days .
The patient also needs a repeat endoscopy and a GI follow-up appointment inapproximately two months .
I have spoken with the patient in detail , and he will be getting in touch with his primary-care physician , Dr. Fordwoodall Stick , in Ranegei Pkwy , Verertliet , South Carolina 62156 .
The patient is to arrange follow up with a GI doctor in Jotar Boulevard , Cunahtampfordama , South Dakota 62848 through his primary-care physician .
The patient was initially on Cimetidine and Carafate here at Bri Health , and then switched to Prilosec 20 mg bid .
5. PULMONARY :
The patient &apos;s admitting chest x-ray showed an elevated left hemidiaphragm consistent with atelectasis versus splinting on that side .
Incentive spirometry was started .
Albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers were done .
The patient received chest physical therapy bid .
6. ENDOCRINE :
The patient needs still better diabetes control .
He has been somewhat noncompliant with his diet ( eating Pringle &apos;s in the room ) .
His NPH was recently increased today ( 10/23/97 ) to 24 units in the a.m. and 14 units in the p.m. with CZI sliding-scale coverage .
7. INFECTIOUS DISEASE :
The patient urinalysis on 10/19/97 showed moderate occult blood , pH 5 , albumin 1+ , white blood cells present , 2-50 red blood cell , 10-20 white blood cells , few bacteria , and moderate bladder epithelial cells .
Floxin 200 mg po bid was begun .
However , his urine culture from the same day remained negative , and this was discontinued two days later .
A repeat urinalysis on 10/22/97 was negative .
8. RENAL :
After the patient &apos;s procedure , he was felt to be volume overloaded .
He was given Lasix 40 mg IV x 1 and also had Nitro paste around the time of his surgery and beta blocker .
The patient became slightly hypotensive on the night of 10/18/97 with systolic blood pressures in the 80s to 90s.
His BUN/ creatinine rose from 16/1.2 on 10/18/97 to 25/1.9 on 10/18/97 to 22/9.1 to today &apos;s labs , which are 15/0.7 on 10/23/97 .
9. HEMATOLOGY :
The patient transfused 2 units on 10/15/97 for a hematocrit of 27.6 .
The patient transfused 2 units of 10/16/97 for a hematocrit of 30.03 .
The patient transfused 1 unit on 10/18/97 for a hematocrit of 29.4 .
The patient transfused 1 unit on 10/19/97 for a hematocrit of 27.9 .
The patient transfused 2 units on 10/20/97 for a hematocrit of 28.2.10 .
FEN :
Repleting potassium , magnesium , phosphorus as needed .
The patient was noted to be slightly hyponatremic over the past few days , with sodiums in the 128-132 range , but this was secondary to elevated glucose fingerstick blood sugars .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
Stable , good .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :

HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient is a 67-year-old gravida 7 , para 7 white female with metastatic endometrial carcinoma who presented with increasing left lower extremity pain for pain management , anemia , diarrhea .
For her anemia , she received two units of packed red blood cells and tolerated this well .
Hematocrit was 29-30 after her two units of packed red blood cells .
For her increasing left lower extremity pain , she received a pain service consult .
Deep venous thrombosis was ruled out , negative lower extremity noninvasive tests .
The Pain Service started her on MSR Contin and Amitriptyline .
After a few days , she found great relief from her left hip pain .
She still , however , was unable to move it adequately with the aid of Physical Therapy .
She began having some hallucinations which she felt were real .
Psychiatry was consulted and they suggested stopping her Amitriptyline which was done and adding Haldol 1 mg at night and b.i.d. as needed .
Because she had increasing tremors and hallucinations .
Neurology felt that her hallucinations were also most likely due to pain medication and her tremors were enhanced physiological tremor and they suggested trying Mescaline at low doses .
It was felt that the MS Contin should be stopped and that she should be started on a PCA .
She was therefore started on a PCA with constant infusion of 0.3 mg / hour and a rescue dose of 0.1 mg every ten minutes times three doses / hour .
She was also started on Mescaline 60 mg p.o. q. day for her tremor .
Also , while in the hospital , the patient developed a Klebsiella pneumonia UTI for which she received seven days of Ancef because she continues to require an indwelling Foley , she was started on Bactrim double strength one p.o. q. day as prophylaxis .
The patient &apos;s cultures from her stool returned positive for C-difficile toxin .
She was , therefore , started on 7-15-91 on Vancomycin 250 mg p.o. q.i.d.
She will continue on this until 7-25-91 .
Her diarrhea has resolved on this medication .
The patient also underwent chemotherapy treatment during this hospital visit .
She first had a Hickman line placed for chemotherapy on 7-17-92 .
She tolerated this procedure well and the Hickman line has continued to function well .
She had a 24-hour urine which had a creatinine clearance of 57 and a normal RBG with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 63% .
Her chemotherapy was not started until 7-19-92 because the treatment had been started for her C-difficile .
By 7-20 , her diarrhea had resolved and she was started on chemotherapy .
She received Adriamycin 54 mg times two and 200 mg / meter squared of Carbo .
She tolerated this chemotherapy well .
She will get biweekly laboratory results followed .
She also was found to have Candida UTI and was treated for two days with Ampicillin , bladder irritation and follow-up culture was negative .
DISPOSITION :
It was felt that the patient required care facility placement and she will be continued on PCA for her pain management .
Therefore , appropriate chronic care facilities were investigated .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
Triacetate 750 mg p.o. t.i.d. ; Atenolol 100 mg p.o. q. day ; Dulcolax one p.o. q. day ; Aquaphor Cream to buttocks p.r.n. ; Senokot one p.o. q. day ; Vancomycin 25 mg p.o. q. 6 hours until 1-20 ; Bactrim double strength one p.o. q. day ; Haldol 1 mg p.o. q. h.s. ; PCA allotted 0.3 mg / hour , rescue dose 0.1 mg every ten minutes three times an hour ; Mysoline 50 mg p.o. q. h.s.
A CBC and SMA-20 should be checked weekly and the results will be followed by the chemotherapy nurse treating .
She will be followed by Dr. Beceneigh .

02/03/98
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Congestive heart failure .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
Coronary artery disease .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
Echocardiogram .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 101-year-old man with a history of severe ischemic cardiomyopathy who presents with weight gain and some shortness of breath .
The patient has a long history of coronary disease starting in 1946 with his first myocardial infarction .
He underwent a CABG for four vessels in 1980 and did well until 1992 when he began to experience episodic chest pain .
He continued to have episodes of angina for the subsequent several years .
He subsequently went to cath in 1994 which showed a native three vessel disease , patent saphenous vein grafts to his diagonal and to his obtuse marginal and diffusely diseased saphenous vein grafts to his RCA .
He had an echo at this time which showed an ejection fraction of 20% with inferolateral akinesis , septal akinesis and diffuse hypokinesis of the LV .
He had severe mitral regurgitation and moderate tricuspid regurgitation at this time .
He subsequently has been managed at a nursing home medically .
He had been doing fairly well on PO medications and has had intermittent admissions for dobutamine holidays with IV diuresis .
The last of such admissions took place in 1997 in July when he was admitted and placed on dobutamine and diuresed to a dry weight of 115 pounds .
He now presents with at least 10 pound weight gain in spite of doses of increasing diuretics .
He also has been complaining of abdominal bloating and reports increased size of his abdomen .
He denies any fevers , chills , sweats , nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , chest pain and only mild shortness of breath .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Coronary disease with ischemic cardiomyopathy as above , hypertension , urinary retention with a chronic indwelling Foley , gout , peripheral vascular disease , basal cell carcinoma , chronic renal insufficiency .

LABORATORY DATA :
Sodium of 139 , potassium of 3.2 , chloride of 96 , bicarb of 32.1 , BUN of 79 , creatinine of 3.4 , glucose of 129 , magnesium of 2.2 and albumin of 3.2 , bilirubins of .4/.9 , alkaline phosphatase of 126 , SGOT of 27 , hematocrit of 27.6 , white count of 4.7 , PT of 13.4 , PTT of 26.5 .
His EKG showed atrial fibrillation versus frequent PVC &apos;s and no acute ST-T wave changes indicative of ischemia .
His chest x-ray showed mild cephalization of vessels but no evidence of overwhelming congestive heart failure and no air space disease .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
The patient was admitted to the hospital and the following issues were addressed :
1. Cardiovascular :
The patient was admitted and placed on IV dobutamine and also IV Lasix for diuresis .
He was also placed on varying vasodilator regimens .
It was thought that his Hydralazine had caused a drug induced lupus .
Initially , he was changed to Cozaar .
His creatinine then began to increase at this time and the patient became hypotensive .
He was then started on amlodipine up to 10 mg. PO QD with more stable blood pressure .
A few days prior to discharge , he was also begun back on his prazosin and currently is at 2 mg. PO QD .
He was aggressively diuresed with a goal dry weight of 121 pounds .
At the time of discharge , he was down to 123 pounds .
This is approximately 10 pounds less than his admission weight .
His dobutamine was discontinued approximately 2 days prior to discharge .
He continued to have a good urine output to a regimen of PO diuresis including Bumex 4 mg. PO BID , aldactone 50 mg. PO BID and Zaroxolyn 5 mg. PO BID .
2. Renal :
The patient has baseline chronic renal insufficiency .
With optimization of his cardiac output and volume status , his creatinine improved to his baseline of 2.0 .
He continues to have approximately 500-700 cc. of urine output every eight hours .
He is fluid restricted to 1 liter of free water .
He should also follow a strict diet including 2 gram salt restriction per day .
3. GU :
The patient has had a Foley in place for several months for urinary retention and BPH .
He has failed a trial of Hydrin after discontinuation of his Foley .
Urology felt that this time that the only other option would be a suprapubic tube which would not decrease the risk of infection .
In consultation with the patient , it was decided to leave the Foley in place and to place him on daily Cipro for UTI prophylaxis .
4. Hematologic :
The patient has mild baseline pancytopenia .
He occasionally has a transfusion .
He was transfused 1 unit of packed red blood cells the day before discharge for a hematocrit of 25 .
His hematocrit at the time of discharge is 30 .
DISPOSITION :
The patient is now discharged stably with a weight of 123 pounds to Lupe Frankcinevirg Asma Ein Health Care for further management .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
Stable .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
Gentamicin ointment to the left eye QHS , Ativan .5 mg. PO TID , Zaroxolyn 5 mg. PO BID , Colace 100 mg. PO TID , Ciprofloxacin 250 mg. PO QD , amlodipine 10 mg. PO QD , Mevacor 20 mg. PO QD , Nitro-patch .6 mg. per hour once a day , digoxin .125 mg. PO QD , iron sulfate 325 mg. PO TID , Cardura 2 mg. PO QHS , aldactone 50 mg. PO BID , and Bumex 4 mg. PO BID .

HISTORY :
Patient is a 73-year-old retired cook with a history of cervical myelopathy , who is admitted for new left hemiparesis .
He had undergone C-spine surgery for spinal stenosis with a question of myelopathy and radiculopathy in 1992 with residual spastic paresis and monoparesis of the left upper extremity , but was ambulatory until a day prior to admission .
At his baseline , he was able to perform limited tasks with his left upper extremity , and was clearly able to move his hand and able to ambulate .
He also at baseline has had urinary and fecal urgencies / incontinence .
His history is now that he has had a week of progressive left upper extremity weakness , to the point of being unable to move the left hand and one day of being unable to walk secondary to left leg weakness with a marked tendency to fall leftward .

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On admission , older , black gentleman in no acute distress with left upper extremity flex across his chest .
His temperatureis 98.9 .
His pressure is 150/90 .
Rate 76 .
Respirations 16 .
He was edentulous .
He had mild copper wiring .
He has a I / VI systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border .
Heart sounds were normal and regular .
Breath sounds were equal bilaterally with course rhonchi .
He had a midline abdominal scar and a reducible umbilical hernia .
Abdomen was otherwise soft and nontender .
He had 2+ carotids , no bruits .
He had gynecomastia .
Rectal was guaiac negative with brown stool , good tone but unable to squeeze .
Extremities :
1+ right posterior tibialis , 2+ left posterior tibialis , no edema , ichthyotic changes were present .
He had 0 left wrist flexion or extension while his left proximal muscles were 4 including his biceps and triceps .
His right arm muscles were also in the range of 4/5.
His hip flexion was 4+ on the right and 4- on the left ; extension 5 on the right , 4+ on the left ; knee flexion evidently trace on the right and 4- on the left with knee extension 5- on the left , 5 on the right ; knee flexion 4- on the left , trace on the right ; ankle dorsi flexion 4- on the left , trace on the right .
Reflexes 4+ overall in the upper extremities and 3+ overall in the lower extremities , an upgoing left toe and a down going right toe .
His tone was increased on the left side and he had diminished pin prick and light touch in his left upper extremity and slightly in his left lower extremity with a similar finding for vibratory sense , but in an unreliable pattern .
He occasionally had extinction in his left upper , greater than lower extremity , but this was fluctuating .
Mental state :
He was awake , occasionally sleepy but easily aroused , oriented to self , Oaksgekesser/ Memorial Hospital and the date .
He was mildly perseverative and inattentive .
Coordination :
his fine finger movements and rapid alternating movements were within normal limits .
He was unable to stand without extensive assistance .
LABORATORY DATA :
Sodium 141 , potassium 3.6 , BUN 14 , creatinine 1.1 , hematocrit 37% , platelets 177 , white blood count 4.1 .
Chest x-ray showed degenerative joint disease , an ill defined left hemi-diaphragm without air space disease .
On the lateral view , surgical clips in the abdomen .
EKG showed normal sinus rhythm , no ST or T wave changes .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
Mr. Finger was admitted for what appeared to be a stroke syndrome involving his left middle cerebral artery territory .
He underwent neurovascular doppler studies which showed no significant change in either common carotid or in the left common internal ophthalmic system .
However , there were hemodynamic changes which raised the question of right siphon disease .
He had normal cervical vertebral arteries .
Transcranial dopplers showed no abnormalities in the ophthalmic siphon systems , distal vertebrals , or proximal basilar artery .
The proximal , middle , anterior and posterior cerebral arteries , however , could not be insinuated .
Over the course of the first hospital day , the patient &apos;s exam deteriorated in a manner that appeared to be blood pressure dependent .
He had been started on Heparin from the time of his admission .
A computerized tomography scan had showed multiple lacunes , right greater than left , and the deep gray and white matters suspicious for proximal middle cerebral artery stem occlusion or stenosis .
MRI / MRA was performed with diffusion weighted images , showing subcortical white matter and basal ganglia infarcts , but preserved middle cerebral artery territory cortex .
Because of his blood pressure , dependence of his left sided extremities , the lower leg specifically , he was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit where he underwent hypertensive therapy for several days .
His systolic blood pressure goal was initially 170-190 , which he was able to achieve spontaneously for the most part .
However , due to the absence of clear benefit at this level , and further deterioration in his left sided strength , this goal was increased and Neo-Synephrine was added to his regimen to achieve mean arterial pressures in the 110-120 range .
This strategy and its incumbent risks , particularly in a patient on Heparin , were discussed at length with both the patient and his family , who were very clear in wanting to proceed with all possible efforts to save the use of his left leg .
While in the Intensive Care Unit , his strength deteriorated from being able to hold his left leg off the bed up to several inches to loosing virtually all distal extremity strength , and having a 2-3/5 power in his proximal left leg groups .
He also , as Neo-Synephrinewas tapered , developed mild sensory findings , in particular diminished large fiber sensibility in his left hand , although he at times , including near the end of his Intensive Care Unit stay had a right gaze preference .
In terms of exploring his visual space , he was able to look to the left , and it was not possible to elicit clear evidence for a field deficit .
He was followed by speech and swallowing service , who assisted in the management of po intake which gradually improved , although he clearly had problems with manipulation of food in the left side of his mouth and would tend to accumulate a pouch of food in his left cheek .
I should mention that his blood pressure therapy was at times limited by a severe headache , although he also had this off the pressor .
He had several repeat imaging studies during his Intensive Care Unit stay which showed further demarcation , but not extension of his prior infarct , both on computerized tomography scan and DWI images .
Additionally , he had a perfusion , diffusion MR study earlier on , which suggested the presence of viable penumbra , including the overlying cortex .
He was transferred to the regular neurology floor once it became clear that he was not receiving any significant benefit from hypertensive therapy .
At this time , his neurologic exam is notable for hemiplegia of his left arm , severe hemiparesis of his left leg , mild large fiber sensory loss in his left arm , and otherwise fairly intact mental status , cranial nerve function , and right sided motor and sensory function .
We anticipate that he represents a good rehab potential .
He will be discharged to rehab on a regimen of Coumadin 5 mg po today then daily for an INR goal of 2-3 , Ofloxacin 400 mg po bid to be discontinued on 11/05/96 , Dexedrine 5 mg po qd , Omeprazole 20mg po qd , Erythromycin eye ointment OU bid , Heparin at its present rate adjusting per partial thromboplastin time bid , and discontinuing when the Coumadin is therapeutic , Tylenol 650 mg po q4 prn , Colace 100 mg po bid .
Follow up will be with Dr. Tvi Fine of Neurology , and Dr. Doll Grendbly of internal medicine and primary care , shortly after discharge from rehab .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS AND REASON FOR ADMISSION :
Mr. Bath is a 77-year-old retired psychologist who was admitted because of a fall .
He has a history of failing memory and difficulty with gait , dating back to 1993 when he had a cat scan which was said to be unremarkable , however , over the past year he has progressively deteriorated in terms of his memory and mental function and over the past six months has rapidly deterioratedwith his gait so that it has recently been very difficult for him to maintain his balance and walk unassisted .
Finally , he fell in his bath tub and was unable to get up .
A nursing assessment thought that it was unsafe for the patient to be at home so he was admitted to the hospital for evaluation .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
there was no evidence of serious trauma .
His general examination revealed a blood pressure of 145/80 ; pulse of 72 and regular .
He was in no acute distress .
His neck was supple .
The chest was normal .
The cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs noted .
The carotids were normal .
There were no bruits .
There was some paravertebral tenderness over the lumbar sign but this was not severe .
The abdomen was soft and non-tender and slightly distended but bowel sounds were present .
There were no masses noted .
The Extremities examination revealed no edema .
Pulses were palpable .
The neurological evaluation revealed that the patient spoke with slow speech with a paucity of expression and monotonal quality .
He was attentive and concentrate but did not perform serial addition or subtraction normally , although it was fair .
He was oriented as to the date and place and some historical details were maintained .
He was unable to ambulate without assistance .
His tone was cog wheeling in the upper extremities and there was a lead pipe type rigidity in the lower extremities .
There were also a few myoclonic jerks .
He also had some frontal lobe signs .
LABORATORY DATA :
upon admission included electrolytes which were normal .
BUN and creatinine were 17 and 1.0 ; digoxin level of .8 ; sugar of 154 ; white blood count of 7.4 ; platelet count of 180,000 ; hematocrit level of 35% .
The electrocardiogram demonstrated an old right bundle branch block , otherwise normal .
The head cat scan was negative .
The lumbar spine films showed an old L-9 compression fracture which was confirmed on cat scanning .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
The patient was evaluated by Dr. Doll Grendbly from the Neurology Service who thought that there was a good possibility that he had Parkinson &apos;s Disease with certainly some Parkinsonian features to his picture .
However , some of his features could be explained by normal pressure hydrocephalus although the normal head scan seemed to exclude that .
There was also a question of Alzheimer &apos;s Disease to explain his dementia .
Dr. Block recommended a trial of Sinemet therapy which was begun in the hospital and he was then transferred to are habilitation hospital for vigorous physical therapy and further evaluation of his Sinemet trial .
He will be followed closely in the out-patient department by both Dr. Block and his primary care physician , Dr. Curling .

Postoperatively , she did well , however she was noted to have a rising carcinoembryonic antigen level in February of 1994 , of 5.7 , and a 42.1 in April of 1994 .
A computerized tomography scan obtained in April of 1994 revealed hepatic metastases involving both lobes .
After two additional cycles of 5-FU and leucovorin , the patient had marked progression of her hepatic metastases associated with tumor fevers .
The computerized tomography scans continued to demonstrate disease confined to the liver .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the Oaksgekesser/ Memorial Hospital on 7-28-94 for placement of an infusaid pump versus an exploratory laparotomy for liver resection .
Prior to surgery , the patient was taken to Vascular Radiology where she underwent superior mesenteric artery and ciliac angiograms .
These demonstrated
1. portal vein patent ,
2. normal hepaticanatomy with normal right and left hepatic arteries ,
3. an enlarged liver with necrotic regions consistent with known colon metastatic tumors .
The patient was subsequently brought to the Operating Room where she underwent a hepatic right trisegmentectomy .
The operative findings were notable for a softball sized tumor in the right lobe of the liver , as well as multiple smaller tumor nodules .
The left lateral segment was grossly free of tumor .
The intraoperative course was notable for acute hypotension with a systolic blood pressure in the fifties .
The patient received 21 liters of lactated Ringers solution , 16 units of packed red blood cells , and 21 units of fresh frozen plasma , and 12 units of platelets .
There were 5300 cc given via the Cellsaver .
The patient was returned to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit .
However , over the ensuing hours , the patient continued to have ongoing blood loss with hypotension .
The decision was made to return the patient to the operating room .
The patient was then returned to the operating room for an exploratory laparotomy for bleeding .
The operative findings were notable for bleeding from the inferior vena cava .
The patient was returned again to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit .
However , again the patient continued to demonstrate ongoing hypotension and transfusion requirements .
The patient required blood pressure support with pressors .
Due to output of approximately 950 cc on placement of a right chest tube , the decision was made to return tothe operating room for exploration for bleeding .
The patient was therefore explored through a right thoracoabdominal incision .
The abdomen was again notable for bleeding from the inferior vena cava , a notable coagulopathy , and therefore , the abdomen was packed and the patient was returned to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit .
However , over the subsequent 8-10 hours , the patient continued to demonstrate declining blood pressure despite maximal support with pressor agents including phenylephrine , norepinephrine , epinephrine , and dopamine .
The patient continued to require transfusions .
The patient &apos;s oxygenation became increasingly difficult , as the chest X-rays demonstrated marked pulmonary edema .
The ventilator settings demonstrated elevating peak inspiratory pressures up to 75 millimeters .
The urine output dropped dramatically , and the patient was treated with Lasix and Mannitol for an attempt at forced diuresis .
As the patient &apos;s hemodynamic parameters demonstrated a narrow pulse pressure and rapidly elevated pulmonary artery pressures , the decision was made to perform echocardiogram to rule out potential paracardial tamponade .
The study was considered to be inadequate , and it was unable definitively rule out the presence of such tamponade .
Despite maximal support with pressor agents , mechanical ventilation , and ongoing transfusion with fresh frozen plasma and packed red blood cells , and a Protamine for treatment of the coagulopathy , the patient continued to demonstrate declining blood pressure , and subsequently expired with a cessation of heart rate and blood pressure at 11:20 p.m. on 7-29-94 .
At this point , the mechanical ventilator was turned off .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
The patient expired .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 25 year old who has a history of a gunshot wound many years ago and has had multiple surgical procedures since then .
Most recently he was admitted to an outside hospital with a drug overdose in adult respiratory distress syndrome and ultimately found to have Candidal pericarditis which eventually led to constrictive pericarditis .
He had a pericardial window .
He had a barium swallow and endoscopy and was said not to have gastric or pericardial ulcer .
He had previous substernal gastric bypass because of an interruption of his esophagus at the time of his gunshot wound .
He had been noted to have an ulcer and ultimately when he stabilized it was our feeling that he most likely had a gastric pericardial ulcer and he was transferred here for further management .
We discussed the risks with his family .
It was a very high risk in very poor condition and a cachectic malnourished edematous individuals who have very high venous pressures and shortness of breath .
The family understood that this was a life saving procedure and only carried with it approximately 50% chance of success .
SPECIAL PROCEDURES AND OPERATIONS :
esophagoscopy , bronchoscopy , pericardectomy , excision of gastric ulcer , repair of gastric ulcer and pectoralis major myocutaneous flap performed on December 4 , 1995 by Dr. Reg Cranka and Dr. Win Shufffyfe .
In lieu of a standard discharge summary given this patient &apos;s complicated hospital course and associated illnesses I feel it best to just provide a system summary concerning this patient &apos;s current status .
1. Neurologic and Psychologic :
The patient is on Nortriptyline for depression .
He is a paraplegic from T4 down .
Otherwise he is awake , alert and appropriate and can respond to questions and can move his upper extremities .
The patient however spends most of his time at bedrest due to decubiti ulcer disease .
2. Cardiac :
The patient had constrictive pericarditis that was relieved by his surgical procedure .
He had a cardiac catheterization on December 1 , 1995 that showed no complications , elevated right atrial pressure and moderate pulmonary hypertension .
The cardiac output was five liters per minute with an index at 2.9 liters per minute per meter 2 which is normal .
A full copy of the cardiac catheterization report is enclosed with his transfer materials .
The patient also underwent cardiac ultrasound on December 11 , 1995 that showed abnormal right ventricle wall motion , trace mitral regurgitation , normal left ventricular size and function with an estimated ejection fraction of 64% .
There is Doppler evidence of tricuspid insufficiency and right atrial dilatation .
There is trace pulmonary insufficiency .
The right ventricle is dilated and diffusely hypokinetic and there is no evidence of constrictive physiology which was seen on December 6 , 1995 .
A copy of this ultrasound is also found in his records .
The patient is on no specific medications for his cardiac condition .
3. Respiratory :
the patient is status post thoracotomy and has staples and sutures on his chest .
These may be removed when the incisions are noted to be well healed .
The patient is approximately three weeks following his procedure and several of these stitches will be removed prior to discharge .
The patient is on oxygen by face mask and his saturations have been remaining normal .
His medications for his respiratory system are Albuterol nebulizer 0.5 mg. 2.5 cc. q4hours .
3. GI :
The patient has had gastric ulcer repair and also has a colostomy .
The patient has a sinus tract that was studied with a fistulogram on December 25 , 1995 .
This showed no communication with the intestines and was simply a sinus tract .
There is no fistula seen .
Dr. Asha Vengloan of General Surgery consulted on the patient and concluded the patient does not require any surgical treatment of this problem at the current time and the best treatment for this situation would be to increase the patient &apos;s nutrition .
The patient takes poorly his po. diet .
However he is able to swallow and tolerate po&apos;s .
He just claims to have no appetite and has very poor effort with feeding .
The patient is able to tolerate po. medicines .
4. GU :
The patient has an ulcer on his penis that has been treated with dressing changes .
It has been noted to be improving .
The patient has a Foley catheter in and when the penile skin is very well healed his Foley catheter may be removed .
Until this time he should be kept on three times daily wet to dry dressing changes .
5. Skin :
The patient has multiple decubiti over his body , in particular his perineum and buttocks have large decubiti .
Plastic Surgery was consulted Dr. Ca Shuff who saw the patient and decided that the patient is not a surgical candidate at this point .
These wounds should be treated with three times daily wet to dry dressings .
The patient &apos;s activity should be limited to being up in a chair only for several minutes per day and sit on a special pad that the family has purchased .
6. Infectious Disease :
The patient &apos;s white count at the time of discharge is within normal limits .
The patient remains on Fluconazole .
His other antibiotics were discontinued .
His most recent cultures are negative .
The chest X-ray shows no evidence of pneumonia .
7. Pain .
The patient has been very closely with the Pain Service here while admitted .
He has been placed on Oxycodone 10 mg. po. q3hours as needed for pain .
The patient had a PCA and several other medications have been discontinued .
The patient has strong narcotic seeking behavior .
The patient for sleep was given Benadryl 25 to 50 mg. qhs. and was not allowed any increases in his narcotics after weaning him down to just requiring the Oxycodone .
A complete summary of the patient &apos;s medications are as follows :
Cimetidine 300 mg. intravenous q6hours .
Albuterol nebulizer 0.5 mg. 2.5 cc. q4hours .
Senokot two tablets po. bid or Metamucil one tablespoon po. bid .
Nortriptyline 25 mg. po. qhs .
KCL 40 mEq. po. bid .
Saline wet to dry dressing changes three times daily to penis and pelvis decubiti , 40% humidified oxygen , Fluconazole 200 mg. po. bid .
Lasix 2.5 mg. intravenous qid .
Prilosec 20 mg. po. qd .
Benadryl 25 to 50 mg. po. qhs prn .
Oxycodone 10 mg. po. q3 hours prn .

In summary this is a 25 year old male with a very complicated history and a patient of Dr. Breunkays &apos;s .
The patient was seen at Ph University Of Medical Center for problem regarding his constrictive pericarditis and underwent a surgical procedure to correct this .
Followup cardiac studies showed there was a resolution of his constrictive pericarditis .
The patient also had a gastric ulcer repaired at the same time .
Other issues of the patient are chronic and most likely will be followed up in hospitals closer to the patient &apos;s home .
If there are any questions regarding his care they should be directed to Dr. Cranka &apos;s office at Ph University Of Medical Center and we will be happy to contact any or all of the consultations concerned with Hauth &apos;s care .
Hauth is a very complicated patient and it was our pleasure to provide care for him at Ph University Of Medical Center .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 5 year old male with multiple anomalies transferred from Capa An- Medical Center of Ohio on 07/20 for management of airway obstruction secondary to tracheal stenosis / history of difficult intubations .
The patient has a history of multiple surgeries and intubations .
On 08/10/90 the patient had surgery to remove granulomas in the trachea after traumatic intubation for seizures .
The patient first presented with stridor and respiratory distress on 02/92 .
A bronchoscopy at that time showed a 50% tracheal stenosis .
Since then the patient has had intermittent episodes of stridor with agitation with upper respiratory tract infections .
On 07/19/92 the patient awoke with significant stridor , respiratory distress and the use of accessory muscles .
The patient was taken to the emergency room where he was taken to the operating room for bronchoscopy .
On 07/19/92 direct laryngoscopy showed an 80% tracheal stenosis beginning just below the sternal notch involving the proximal 50th percent of the trachea .
They were unable to get to the distal part of the trachea .
The patient was a difficult intubation and it was finally performed by a thoracic surgeon using a 3.5 endotracheal tube .
The patient was then hospitalized in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit at Asney Ewood Health Care in Losbroke Pringda Field Delp U and maintained with Pavulon and Morphine .
Dr. Fields was consulted and the patient was transferred by Ton Len N&apos;ss Community Hospital to Ph University Of Medical Center Pediatric Intensive Care Unit for evaluation and management by Dr. Fields on 07/20 in the p.m.
The patient was reportedly in his usual state of health immediately prior to this hospitalization with no history of upper respiratory tract infection symptoms , fever , cough , vomiting , diarrhea or decreased appetite .
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM :
1. Respiratory :
The patient remained intubated and maintained on a Pavulon and Morphine drip through until 7/21/92 .
The patient was brought to the Operating Room where bronchoscopy was done .
The patient was noted to have a stenosis of the proximal trachea approximately 3 cm long just below the vocal cords .
The patient was also noted to have mild right mainstem bronchus stenosis too .
Very mild .
The patient had a 3-0 Shiley trach placed approximately 1 cm below the vocal cords .
The trach extends approximately 1 cm below the area of stenosis .
Chest X-Rays shows clear lung fields bilaterally with the trach tube noted to be in good position .
I should also note that the patient has had multiple tracheal aspirates sent for culture and they have all been negative .
There is one Gram stain that showed some polys but otherwise they have been unremarkable .
There is no clinical evidence of pneumonia that could have precipitated this event and all X-Rays have been unremarkable .
The patient has a history of significant hyperinflation of the chest with an increased AP diameter which is mildly improved after the tracheostomy .
The patient received oxygen for approximately 24 hours after the tracheostomy and is presently being maintained on room air with a humidified mask .
The patient generally breaths between 20 and 30 breaths per minute and is otherwise stable .
Cardiac :
The patient is otherwise stable .
The patient had some evidence of doubled T waves on the day of arrival .
These T waves have since cleared and the patient is otherwise unremarkable .
Please note that the last arterial blood gases was Ph 7.40 , PCO2 of 41 , PO2 of 112 , bicarbonate of 25 .
Fluids and Nutrition :
The patient was initially NPO and then begun on Pediasure feeds the first two days of hospitalization .
The patient has presently been weaned over to his regular diet which is generally some crackers , cereal and occasional bits of food .
The patient generally does not drink much fluid .
GI :
From a gastrointestinal point of view please note on ______________ at 5 a.m. the patient was noted to be aspirating bits of cereal and juices via his trach tube .
This was felt to be mild aspiration .
The patient also had episodes of frequent coughing .
Clinical examination shows no decreased breath sounds .
The repeat X-Ray is generally clear and the patient is generally in no distress .
The patient was made NPO on 7/25 a.m. Dr. Fields &apos;s team is coming to evaluate the patient .
Recommendations include probable evaluation for aspiration of upper airway contents and possible G tube placement in the future .
The patient has a history of longstanding constipation generally requires an enema every couple of days .
KUB on 7/23 showed hugely dilated loops of colon and small bowel which only briefly respond to an enema .
The patient last received enema on 7/24 in the p.m.
HEM :
The patient has generally been stable .
His initial hematocrit was 31% .
His hematocrit on transfer was 33% .
The platelet count was 351,000 .
The patient never received blood during the procedure .
The estimated blood loss was minimal .
Renal :
The patient has always had good urine output with normal BUN and creatinine .
Neurological :
The patient has a history of of seizure disorder .
He has been stable here .
He is presently being weaned off his Phenobarbital and advanced onto Tegretol by his Neurologist in Vanri , SC .
Levels on arrival showed a Phenobarbital level of 25 , Tegretrol level of 3.1 .
The patient has had problems taking p.o. Tegretol during this hospitalization and levels need to be checked in the near future .
Phenobarbital has been maintained by intravenous 30 mg b.i.d.
Infectious Disease :
The patient arrived receiving ceftriaxone for one day down in Mississippi .
The patient was switched over to Ancef to cover for Staph and usual flora for possible pneumonia .
The child only had a one time spike on pod 1 to 103 .
Three trach aspirates have all been unremarkable .
The blood cultures are unremarkable , sputum cultures are unremarkable , urinalysis was also negative .
The patient cannot be cathed as he has a recent hypospadias repair .
The patient is still being maintained on Ancef at the request of Dr. Fields &apos;s team .
DOCTORS DISCHARGE ORDERS :
The patient will be transferred to Ral Medical Center in Saintarv on 7/25/92 by ambulance .
The patient has a 3-0 Shiley in place that is stitched to his neck and also has trach ties in places .
The trach appears to be quite stable and the patient is tolerating having his trach in quite nicely with a humidified mask .
The plans per ENT are that the patient &apos;s trach will not be changed for at least one months time .
Dr. Fields will contact Dr. Roosekote as to probable plans .
It appears that Dr. Fields wants to re-evaluate the child in 4 to 6 weeks with another bronchoscopy and feels that possibly tracheal reconstruction may be possible at that time .
The parents are being transferred back to Newstonpend to learn trach care and to set up homecare .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
STATUS POST MULTIPLE EMBOLISMS AND LEFT VENTRICULAR THROMBUS PROCEDURES :
LEFT VENTRICULAR THROMBECTOMY .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a 63 year old patient who had no significant medical history until 1987 , when he developed a left arm embolism which was treated with SVG from the left thigh .
The postop course was uncomplicated with an embolus occluding the graft and a CVA .
In 04-90 , the patient suffered an intestinal embolism requiring an ileostomy which was closed in 09-90 .
In 09-90 , the patient developed a second CVA presenting with slurred speech which resolved without residual .
The patient presents now with a 3 month history of dizziness and mood changes .
He also complains of continued left arm paresthesias .
The patient also reports that he had a large silent MI in 01-89 , which was uncomplicated .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
After admission to the Medical Service , the patient underwent work up for embolism source and source for his dizziness .
His search had previously been negative .
A recent echo showed 1+ MR , inferior apical and left ventricular akinesis and a 3 x 2.5 cm spherical mass in the inferior apical left ventricle .
This finding was in concurrence with findings of a cardiac cath performed on 2-12-92 .
The patient was then transferred to the Cardiac Surgery Service for the removal of this left ventricular mass .
Coronary angiography during the cardiac cath had revealed normal coronaries without coronary artery disease .
After the usual preparation , the patient was taken to the OR on 2-14-92 , and underwent left ventriculotomy and removal of the left ventricular thrombus .
The pathological examination of the removed material revealed a blood clot with thrombus .
The patient tolerated the procedure well .
During the early postop period , he was kept on IV Dextran and was restarted on Coumadin .
His further postop course was complicated by a recurrent episode of dizziness .
His neurologic work up , however , was negative .
A repeat echo showed no recurrent intraventricular thrombus and a carotid Doppler study was negative .
The patient suffered no further dizzy spells during the further postop days .
He was discharged in good condition on 2-22-92 .
DISPOSITION :
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
Synthroid .1 mg po q d , Metamucil one pack po q d , Persantine 50 mg po t.i.d. , Lopressor 25 mg po b.i.d. , Anusol cream at anal t.i.d. , Coumadin for PTT equal 20 seconds as directed , Albuterol inhaler two puffs q 6 h prn .
FOLLOW UP CARE :
Since our Hematology consultant recommended to keep the patient &apos;s PT in the range of 20-22 seconds , the patient will require close follow up of his PT&apos;s while on Coumadin .
This was discussed with the patient &apos;s local medical doctor , Dr. Royneo Walla .
The patient will receive further follow up including evoked potential studies by our Neurology Service .
He has an appointment with Dr. O Kotea for his cardiac surgical follow up 4 weeks post discharge .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 74 year old right hand dominant white female with a history of primary central nervous system lymphoma , diagnosed in March , 1994 , status post twelve cycles of high dose methotrexate , status post two cycles of high dose ARA-C chemotherapy , who was admitted with a chief complaint of rectal bleeding and decreasing platelet count .
In March 1994 patient developed 2-3 months of headaches , cognitive changes , dizziness and memory loss .
An MRI showed enhancing white marrow lesions at the bifrontal lobes on the right side , and rightsided basal ganglion in the right cerebral peduncle .
The patient underwent a biopsy which showed a primary CNS lymphoma .
The patient was initially treated with high-dose methotrexate for six cycles .
However , the patient developed left IIIrd nerve palsy and an MRI showed increasing lesion in the left ______________ cerebral peduncle and the left mid brain .
The patient was reinduced with high dose methotrexate , 8 mg / meter sq. with some initial tumor response .
However , when the patient was started on 3.5 gm / meter sq. maintenance dose , the tumor progressed .
At that point , the patient was switched over toe high-dose ARA-C ( 2.5 gm / meter sq ) .
On the high-dose ARA-C chemotherapy , the patient developed bone marrow suppression requiring intermittent Neupogen ( GCSF ) support .
The patient was recently discharged from the hospital after her second cycle of high-dose ARA-C chemotherapy .
The patient remained stable to the last few days prior to admission when she developed insidious rectal bleeding , probably from her external hemorrhoids , along with decreasing platelet count .
On the day of admission the patient &apos;s platelet count dropped to 28,000 and the patient was admitted for her platelet transfusions and further work up for her rectal bleeding .
The patient complained of chronic constipation and rectal bleeding after each bowel movement .
LABORATORY DATA :
CBC on 4/25/95 :
white blood count 5,000 , hematocrit 38 , platelet count 50,000 .
On April 26 , white blood count 2.5 , hematocrit 29 , platelet count 32,000 .
On April 27 , white blood count 1.6 , hematocrit 28.9 , platelet count 28,000 :
66 polys , 8 bands with ANC of 1056 .
Sodium 136 , potassium 3.3 , chloride 103 , bicarb 26 , BUN 24 , creatinine 0.7 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient developed substernal chest pain without radiation on the night of admission .
An electrocardiogram showed flat ST change in lead III , otherwise unremarkable and the patient was given sublingual nitroglycerin without symptomatic improvement .
The patient was given 2 units of packed RBC along with the six units of platelet transfusion .
The patient &apos;s symptoms improved with the above measures and the patient no longer complained of chest pain during the hospitalization .
The patient &apos;s platelet count improved to 76,000 on the following morning ; however , her white blood count dropped to 900 with 58 polys with 8 bands .
Because of significant neutropenia , the patient was put on reverse isolation and started on GCSF injections .
The patient &apos;s white blood count improved with the GCSF and her counts went up to 18.2 on the day of discharge .
The patient &apos;s hemoglobin improved to 10.0 after the transfusion and her rectal bleeding apparently stopped .
A GI consultation was made and they felt that the rectal bleeding is most likely from the hemorrhoids and no further intervention was felt to be necessary .
After the transfusion the patient &apos;s platelet count improved to 101,000 on May 2 .
The patient had a follow up MRI scan which showed no significant change of tumor mass .
However , in lieu of a persistent bone marrow suppression from chemotherapy , it was decided that she should undergo radiation therapy .
The patient was assimilated on the day of discharge and the patient will be started on radiation therapy in a few days .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
Decadron 6 mg po tid ; and she should continue Inderal , Synthroid and Zoloft at the present dose and frequency .

FINAL DIAGNOSIS :
Cervical carcinoma ; bilateral ureteral obstruction secondary to the cancer .
Uremia .
Ileus .
OPERATION :
Bilateral ureteral stent placement .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This 78-year-old woman had stage IIIB carcinoma of the cervix and she has known periaortic and splenic metastases .
She was discharged from the hospital about 18 days prior to her admission , following a month long stay .
When her cancer was diagnosed , she underwent total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy .
She had extensive disease of the uterus , ovarian tubes , omentum and the periaortic lymph nodes .
Postoperatively , she developed ileus , then finally she recovered and she was discharged to the nursing home .
She was readmitted because of a problem with uremia and high BUN and creatinine when she seen in the office and the BUN and creatinine was ordered .
The BUN was 70 and creatinine was 4.6 and for this reason she had ultrasound of the kidney which showed bilateral hydronephrosis .
The patient was admitted to the hospital for ureteral stent placement .
On the day of admission , she was generally stable and she had no evidence of disease in the pelvis , no bleeding and no other abnormality .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Dr. Jescdrig was called and a consultation was done and he placed bilateral ureteral stents in her kidneys .
Postoperatively , she diuresed very well .
She had dropped her BUN and creatinine to normal and she was found to have may be metastatic disease to her skin on the right paraumbilical area .
Because of her age and mental condition and the fact that she had cerebral atrophy , the decision was made for comfort unless she has any further problem and no further chemotherapy or treatment will be given .
The possibility that she may need to receive radiation therapy to this area to prevent her from getting further obstruction was also brought up .
Her family felt that at the present time , because her condition was no good , they would like to just take her home so that she could enjoy the quality of life .
Indeed , at the time of discharge she was conscious and she was cooperative and she was able to communicate very nicely with everyone including her family , except for the mental instability that she had because of her cerebral atrophy due to senility .
FOLLOW-UP :
She will be followed in the Centu Fairgmer Queen Medical Center .

HOSPITAL COURSE :
This is a 72-year-old male with a history of thymoma resected in 1996 , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , hypothyroidism who was transferred from Gobay Hos Memorial Hospital for an myocardial infarction and cardiac catheterization .
The patient developed shortness of breath at home and the EMTs were called and the patient was found to be in respiratory distress .
He was transferred to Gobay Hos Memorial Hospital where chest x-ray showed left lower lobe infiltrate and cardiac enzymes were elevated with a CK of 297 , MB fraction of 38 and troponin of 12 .
The patient was transferred to the medicine service at the Retelk County Medical Center and underwent cardiac catheterization which was negative for disease .
He continued to complain of shortness of breath with an episode of respiratory failure in the hospital requiring 100% nonrebreather .
Neurology was consulted for difficulty lifting his arms .
On consultation the patient admitted to dysphasia and periods of diplopia in the past .
The patient was found to have weakness in the proximal muscles as well as the capability of the muscles .
He was started on IV ig and IV Solu-Medrol for a diagnosis of myasthenia gravis given his past history of thymoma .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Ms. Kotekoorsner is a 57 year old white woman with mitral stenosis , atrial fibrillation , and cardiac risk factors including a positive family history , hypertension , and hypercholesterolemia who presented for catheterization because of progressive worsening of fatigue and dyspnea on exertion .
The patient was told that she had a heart murmur approximately twenty years ago .
However , she had been asymptomatic at that time .
She now gives a history of progressively worsening dyspnea on exertion and fatigue which has become more incapacitating over the past several months .
She states that previously , she had been fairly active but now does not feel that she can do much of anything .
She denies chest pain but complains of episodes of light headedness accompanied by diaphoresis which occur at rest approximately once per week and last for several minutes .
She also complains of a tight feeling in her abdomen .
She also has had a cough for the past several years which is worse in the wintertime and is non-productive .
She denies hemoptysis , orthopnea , or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea .
She complains of ankle swelling for the past several months .
Her course has been complicated by atrial fibrillation first diagnosed in New Years Eve of l989 and she has been on Digoxin and Coumadin .
Because of her worsening symptoms , the patient had an echocardiogram at an outside hospital in Chogejuan St.ver , New Hampshire in September of l989 which showed mitral stenosis .
She is now referred to the Retelk County Medical Center for evaluation of her mitral valvular disease .
The patient &apos;s cardiac risk factors include a positive family history in that both parents died in their fifties of heart disease and two brothers had coronary artery bypass graft procedures in their thirties , hypercholesterolemia for several years , and hypertension .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
There is no history of rheumatic heart disease recalled by the patient , removal of benign lump in the left breast .
CURRENT MEDICATIONS :
Coumadin 5 mg q.d. ( this was discontinued one week prior to admission ) , Digoxin 0.25 mg q.d. , Mevacor 20 mg q.d. , Propranolol 20 mg q.d. , and Penicillin for dental procedures .
ALLERGIES :
She had no known drug allergies .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
The patient lives with her husband in Glendmin .
She has four children , ages 22 through 27 , and works as a cook at a grammer school .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Ms. Kotekoorsner is a very pleasant woman who appears her stated age and is in no acute distress .
Vital signs showed that she had a blood pressure on the right which was l80/ll0 and a blood pressure on the left arm which was l84/ll0 , her pulse was 90 and was irregularly irregular , and her respirations were l6 per minute and were unlabored .
HEENT :
Unremarkable .
LUNGS :
Clear to auscultation and percussion .
CARDIAC :
Carotid arteries showed normal upstroke and volume without bruits bilaterally .
There was jugular venous distention to l7 cm at 45 degrees .
The point of maximal impulse was at the fifth intercostal space in the mid clavicular line .
There was a left parasternal lift .
There was a loud Sl and a physiologically split S2 with a prominent P2 component .
There was an opening snap immediately following the P2 .
There was a diastolic rumble at the apex which radiates to the axilla which is graded as a I / VI .
There was also a I / VI apical systolic murmur .
The patient &apos;s peripheral pulses were full .
There was no evidence of edema in the extremities .
ABDOMEN :
Soft , slightly distended , and there was a slight right upper quadrant fullness .
NEUROLOGICAL :
Non-focal .
However , there was evidence of subtle mental status change on the evening after the patient &apos;s valvuloplasty .
She was having difficulty remembering certain events which had occurred that day .
It was felt that because her neurological examination was non-focal at this time and that these changes represented no real change in her mental status from the time of admission , that no further work-up was required .
DISPOSITION :
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
Nadalol 20 mg p.o. q.d. , Coumadin 5 mg p.o. q.h.s. , Mevacor 20 mg q.d. , and Digoxin 0.25 mg q.d.

3) CORD COMPRESSION .
4) STEROID INDUCED DIABETES MELLITUS .
5) PLASMACYTOMA .
6) POOR NUTRITIONAL STATUS .
7) THROMBOCYTOPENIA STATUS POST BONE MARROW TRANSPLANT .
8) MULTIPLE MYELOMA .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a 59-year-old white male .
The patient has had multiple myeloma since 1990 .
He underwent an autologous bone marrow transplant in 10/92 at Petersly Hospital And Medical Center .
At that time he received total body irradiation of 1400 cGy .
This bone marrow transplant did not produce remission and then he was treated with three cycles of VAD subsequently .
In 08/94 , the patient developed lower back pain .
A workup done in DE is not available at the time of this dictation .
According to her scanty records , an MRI of the spine showed diffuse spinal column involvement with lesions in T4 and T8 with no cord compression at that time .
He was then treated with radiation therapy from T3 to T9 receiving 2500 cGy from 08/94 to 09/94 .
He has been on Decadron since 08/94 .
About two weeks prior to admission the patient developed mid back pain , burning in nature with radiation around the right lower ribs .
He also began to develop noticeably increasing bilateral lower extremity weakness and possibly numbness in the lower extremities .
He stated that he had difficulty rising from a chair .
An MRI without gadolinium done on 11/20/94 of the spine showed a right posterior lateral epidural mass extending from T9 to T12 .
There was evidence of cord compression .
The patient &apos;s Decadron dose was increased to 12 mg q day and he was also started on MS Contin and radiation therapy was being planned and arranged at the Petersly Hospital And Medical Center .
However , one day prior to admission the patient developed right lower extremity pain and could not walk secondary to the pain .
Over the next 12 hours while in transit to the hospital , the patient &apos;s right lower extremity became red , swollen , and increasingly painful .
He has had chronic bilateral lower extremity swelling since his transplant but the right lower extremity swelling was noticeably increased .
He also complained of some fecal incontinence the day prior to admission without urinary incontinence .
At the time of presentation the patient denied headache , arm weakness , changes in vision , dysarthria , abdominal pain , nausea or vomiting , chest pain or shortness of breath .
He was taken to Huyychestleme Health Of in Scoo , Utah where he had a temperature of 99.9 , blood pressure 90/50 , heart rate 128 , and O2 sat of 91% on room air .
Blood cultures , urine culture , and UA were all done .
Blood cultures drawn on admission subsequently grew Pseudomonas aeruginosa .
He was treated with Ceftazidime , gentamicin , and Vancomycin and also was started on a Dopamine drip for treatment of his sepsis .
A Swan was placed and initial readings were CVP of 6 , wedge pressure of 10 to 12 , cardiac index of 4.7 , and SVR of 438 all consistent with a Pseudomonas sepsis picture .
He was given stress steroids and was subsequently transferred to Lorough Medical Center &apos;s Intensive Care Unit for further management .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
1) Multiple myeloma .
2) Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation .
3) Plasmacytoma of T9 through T12 .
4) Chronic renal insufficiency .
5) Chronically low platelet count .
6) Failed autologous bone marrow transplant in 10/92 .
7) Hypothyroidism .
FAMILY HISTORY :

Abdomen non-distended , positive bowel sounds , soft , non-tender , no hepatosplenomegaly or masses .
Rectal normal tone , guaiac positive brown stool , no perirectal lesions or erythema .
Extremities reveal the right lower extremity was tense , purple-red , swollen , and was warm from the knee to the ankle and extremely tender .
There was pitting edema of both lower extremities but no evidence of cellulitis of the left lower extremity .
Neurological exam on admission revealed he was drowsy but easily arousable to voice , oriented to person , Retelk County Medical Center , and date , able to say no but mildly inattentive during examination .
Cranial nerves intact .
Motor exam normal tone , positive asterixis , no drift .
Strength was decreased in both lower extremities .
Coordination was normal with good finger to nose , gait was not tested .
Deep tendon reflexes were 2+ in the upper extremities , 1+ in the patella reflexes , no reflexes at the ankles , upgoing Babinski toes bilaterally .
LABORATORY DATA :
On admission revealed white blood cell count 4.2 , Hct 27 , platelet count 28 .
Glucose 191 .
PT 17.6 , PTT 48.7 , fibrinogen 686 , TT 39.2 .
Magnesium 1.7 .
UA showed no white blood cells , positive granular casts .
Chest x-ray was without infiltrates , wand in good position .
An MRI was performed upon admission and showed an epidural mass at the right posterior lateral T9 to T12 area invading the neural foramina .
There was no CSF density .
These findings were consistent with the cord compression .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
By problems -
1) INFECTIOUS DISEASE / CELLULITIS :
The patient &apos;s clinical situation was most consistent with a Pseudomonas cellulitis and subsequent sepsis .
Blood cultures drawn at the outside hospital grew out Pseudomonas that was sensitive to Imipenem and Tobramycin .
There were cultures obtained seeping from the wound at Retelk County Medical Center and those also grew out Pseudomonas aeruginosa .
The organism grown at this institution was sensitive to Imipenem , Ceftazidime , Amikacin , gentamicin , Ciprofloxacin , Tobramycin but was resistant to Cefotetan , Ceftriaxone , Mezlocillin , Bactrim , Ampicillin , chloramphenicol , and sulbactam .
He was treated initially with Ceftazidime and gentamicin but there was a question about the organism &apos;s susceptibility from lab studies done at the outside hospital .
He was subsequently switched to Imipenem and Tobramycin and was maintained on those medications throughout the hospital course .
The Tobramycin and Imipenem were started on 11/25/94 .
In addition , the patient received a five day course of intravenous IgG to improve infection control .
Vancomycin was also added to his regimen on 11/28/94 and this was primarily to provide improved MRSA coverage as he continued to have erythema along the lateral right lower extremity .
He was evaluated by the Surgery Department and it is there feeling that there is no indication for surgical intervention / amputation at this time .
He is being maintained with twice daily Xeroform with Betadine changes .
These dressing changes are applied by applying the Xeroform on Betadine initially and then changing it with sterile dry bandages .
Of note , the patient has extreme pain with these dressing changes and requires parenteral morphine sulfate for pain control during dressing changes .
The plan is to complete a full course of Imipenem and Tobramycin for his Pseudomonas cellulitis .
As mentioned earlier he continues to have erythema tracking up his leg and up to his lateral thigh .
The cause of this erythema is not know at this time but has not shown extensive progression .
2) CARDIOVASCULAR :
The patient was initially treated with Dopamine which was subsequently weaned off after his sepsis improved .
He was noted to be in rapid AF on several episodes receiving 5 mg IV Lopressor each time with improvement .
He has been in and out of atrial fibrillation and normal sinus rhythm .
An echocardiogram performed at the outside hospital while he was septic showed decreased global EF .
The patient is being maintained on Digoxin for his paroxysmal atrial fibrillation .
He has had no significant episode of tachycardia or blood pressure alteration during the final days of hospitalization .
The plan is to continue the Digoxin and to recheck an echocardiogram to assess his ejection fraction when he is clinically better .
3) ONCOLOGY :
The patient has a plasmacytoma affecting the spine .
He has been receiving radiation therapy to that area during the hospital stay .
The plan is to complete a full course of XRT to the spinal region for the plasmacytoma .
The patient &apos;s lesion compressing his thoracic spine was never biopsied , however , the MRI appearance does not seem to be infectious and is most consistent with plasmacytoma for which he is receiving the radiation therapy .
4) NEUROLOGIC :
As mentioned above he has a cord compression and is on steroids .
He was initially treated with IV Decadron 10 mg up front and then 6 mg q6h.
His neurological exam remained stable with no evidence of increasing lower extremity edema .
His Decadron dose was titrated down to 5 mg IV q6h on 12/3/94 .
His Decadron dose will be slowly titrated down over time following his neurological exam closely .
5) BLOOD SUGARS :
The patient has steroid induced diabetes mellitus .
He has been on increasing doses of insulin receiving NPH in the morning and night in addition to a CZI sliding scale on a q6h basis .
The plan is to continue the supplemental insulin while he is on steroids and while his sugars remain high .
6) RESPIRATORY :
He initially required a face mask to keep his saturation above 90% .
However , with increasing diuresis and improving septic pictures his O2 saturations have improved and he is now on nasal cannula and will be maintained on nasal cannula to keep his sat above 93% .
He can be given intravenous Lasix as needed for any evidence of respiratory compromise or increasing pulmonary edema .
7) NUTRITION :
The patient has a poor nutritional status with hypoalbuminemia .
He has been maintained on tube feeds and that should be continued .
He should also be encouraged to eat as much as possible orally in addition to this tube feeds and aspiration precaution should be maintained .
8) ELEVATED PT and PTT :
Both of these responded to three day course of vitamin K 10 mg each day .
His PT and PTT are now normal , however , he continues to run a low platelet count .
This has been evident since the time of his bone marrow transplant .
We have been transfusing him with platelets to keep his counts above 20,000 to reduce his bleeding risk .
He also received several blood transfusions while here to maintain his Hct around 30 .
Thrombocytopenic inducing drugs should be avoided if possible on this patient .

This took place in 1983 .
In 1992 he underwent redo surgery and aortic valve replacement .
In April 1994 he presented with an acute inferior myocardial infarction and was given Streptokinase .
He had recurrent pain and went to the Catheter Laboratory where a proximal right coronary artery lesion was angioplastied .
A relook several days later led to a repeat percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty .
He has has stable , mild angina , subsequently , mostly in the setting of stress .
Slightly increased in recent months .
On the day of admission , he was involved in a minor motor vehicle accident , and there was some apparent controversy with the driver of the other vehicle , during the course of which he developed substernal chest pain radiating to the left arm and shoulder .
This waxed and waned for thirty to sixty minutes , and he took a number of nitroglycerins .
After returning home after conferring with his wife , and the pain lasted another half hour , he came to the emergency room .
His electrocardiogram showed increased T wave inversions in V3 and V4 and 1 mm .
ST segment depression in V3 through V6 .
His examination was largely benign after he was made pain free .
The pulse was 75 , blood pressure 120/80 , respirations 18 , and he was afebrile .
The jugular veins were not distended , the carotid volume was diminished .
The chest was clear and the cardiac rhythm was regular .
There were normal prothetic valves .

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :
UTERINE PROLAPSE .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a 70 year old gravida IV , para 4 who presented for a vaginal hysterectomy secondary to uterine prolapse and also presented for evaluation of a suspicious lesion seen on a mammogram .
Patient &apos;s problem started four years ago when she first experienced a pushing forward of her uterus .
The patient described this sensation as uncomfortable and becoming more prominent over the following three years with increasing pressure and pain .
Two months ago , the patient slipped and fell with valsalva that precipitated an exacerbation of her prolapse .
She subsequently could not urinate and was in pain secondary to her problem .
At this time , she decided that she needed the prolapse fixed and actually wrote to the Norri Hospital to try and find a Gynecologist .
Her letter was referred to Dr. Earllamarg Para who saw her in the office and recommended vaginal hysterectomy .
Patient has never had a pessary and refused one and denies nausea , fever , chills , dysuria , or stress incontinence on her current admission .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :

ADMISSION DATE :
07-01-93
DISCHARGE DATE :
07-26-93
DISCHARGED TO SOUTHOBASSKING&apos;S VILLEMARG HOSPITAL .
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Acute polymicrobial bacterial endocarditis .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSES :
Ascending aortic dissection , cutaneous drug eruption , diarrhea , congestive heart failure , pulmonary edema , anuric renal failure , stroke , postoperative bleeding , mitral regurgitation , history of rheumatic fever .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
7/21/93 - mitral valve replacement and replacement of ascending aorta .
OTHER PROCEDURES :
06/29/93 - white cell scan ; 07/03/93 - cardiac ultrasound ; 07/05/93 - brain magnetic resonance imaging study ; 07/05/93 - abdominal computerized tomography scan ; 07-08-93 - cardiac ultrasound ; 07/07/93 - pelvic ultrasound ; 07/09/93 - barium enema ; 7/14/93 - cardiac catheterization and coronary angiography ; 7/15/93 - cardiac ultrasound ; 7/21/93 - reopening of sternum ; 07/22/93 - mediastinal exploration .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This extremely complex 75 year old woman was admitted from an outside hospital with fever .
She was in her usual state of health until 6/15/93 when she began to experience intermittent confusion , diarrhea , and fevers up to 104 , associated with chills .
There were transient mental status changes but no convulsions or loss of consciousness .
She was also noted to have some diarrhea at this time .
Because of increasing mental status changes , the patient was admitted to O Center in Sondibrid Ey on 6/20 , and she was found to have a gram-positive urinary tract infection , high fever , and was started on Ciprofloxacin .
Blood cultures drawn on admission showed multiple organisms including Clostridium perfringens , coagulase negative Staph , and alpha hemolytic Streptococcus .
Her antibiotics were appropriately changed .
At the family &apos;s request , the patient was transferred to Heaonboburg Linpack Grant Medical Center for further evaluation .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Further evaluation at Heaonboburg Linpack Grant Medical Center , demonstrated that the patient had mitral valve endocarditis with mitral regurgitation that was initially managed medically .
Her antibiotics were appropriately adjusted because of the polymicrobial nature .
Cardiac echo showed that she had moderate mitral regurgitation , an enlarged left atrium , and good ventricular function .
There was a suggestion of mitral valve vegetation .
She was placed on intravenous antibiotics with gradual decrease in her temperature , although some low grade temperatures initially persisted .
The patient had an extensive evaluation over the days that followed in order to find potential sources .
She was evaluated by the Gynecology Service including the performance of a pelvic ultrasound and also by the GI Service where she underwent a barium enema .
There was no evidence of GI or pelvic disease which would account for the bacterial source .
In addition , she was evaluated by the Sileyer Medical Center and there was no evidence of active dental infection .
She had a cerebral magnetic resonance imaging study performed and there was evidence of stroke .
Because of her complex picture , and because the source of her sepsis was not found , the initial plan was to treat with antibiotics and hopefully obtain a completely sterile surgical field for subsequent valve replacement , if indicated .
Her temperature became low grade and it was initially stable with her mitral regurgitation .
Towards the end of June , she had become afebrile and the initial plan was to complete a full course of antibiotics to obtain a sterile surgical field .
A rash developed and antibiotics were appropriately changed and antibiotic levels were optimized .
On 7/13 , she developed a sudden episode of pulmonary edema that resolved quickly and she was thought to have possible worsening of her mitral regurgitation .
She was moved to the Intensive Care Unit and underwent subsequent cardiac catheterization in preparation for possible surgery .
Her cardiac catheterization demonstrated minor coronary artery disease and severe mitral regurgitation with a suggestion of an annular abscess .
After considerable discussion among the physicians involved in the patient &apos;s care , it had become apparent that the mitral regurgitation had worsened .
Also , no source for sepsis had been found .
Because of worsening mitral regurgitation , and the findings of severe mitral regurgitation at cardiac catheterization , as well as elevated filling pressures , it was everyone &apos;s opinion that the patient would not wait to complete a long course of antibiotics .
Accordingly , she was taken to the operating room on 7/21/93 .
During her cardiac procedure , she sustained dissection of the ascending aorta .
She , therefore , underwent graft replacement of her ascending aorta and mitral valve replacement .
Her valve was excised and any material that appeared infected was debrided .
It was possible to clean the area thoroughly and it also became apparent that there was evidence of calcification in and around the annulus consistent with prior rheumatic fever .
Her valve was replaced with a St. Jude Medical mitral prosthesis and it was possible to place the valve securely .
She weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass with hemodynamics consistent with extreme vasodilation , and she required enormous doses of vasoconstrictors to maintain her blood pressure .
She was bleeding after operation with her picture also consistent with coagulopathy , and the overall picture suggested the effects of systemic sepsis .
In the early postoperative period , she had evidence of tamponade , possibly related to compression from her lungs , as the patient was noted to have elevated inspiratory pressures on the ventilator .
The sternum was reopened with improvement in her hemodynamics and additional stability .
She was returned to the operating room on 07/22 and underwent mediastinal exploration , removal of some mediastinal clot , and by now , hemostasis had improved .
Her sternum was left opened and the skin wound was left opened , using an elastic membrane to close the chest .
With clotting factor replacement , bleeding gradually abated and was no longer a problem .
She subsequently developed ongoing manifestations of sepsis with sustained vasodilation and developed anuric renal failure which required peritoneal dialysis .
She remained on full support in the Intensive Care Unit , on dialysis , with ongoing evidence of acidosis .
Despite full support on multiple , high dose inotropic and vasoconstrictor agents , her clinical status continued to deteriorate and it became apparent that her prognosis was extremely poor .
After consultation with the family , it was decided to not resuscitate her and , with continued deterioration , she expired on 07/26/93 at 11:10 a.m.
Autopsy permission was granted .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This patient is a 77 year old female who has had a Hancock mitral valve replacement on 10/28/76 by Dr. Melvean Ace .
She had a bypass graft with marginal artery at that time , with a flow of 85 cc. &apos;s .
She subsequently had done well , although she had had chronic obstructive lung disease .
She had been converted to normal sinus rhythm in 1977 , but in 1988 , the mitral valve on an echocardiogram was O.K.
Her ejection fraction was 81% , with no mitral regurgitation seen , with a peak gradient of 9 and a mean gradient of about 3 .
In 1988 , she developed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma , and has been followed by Dr. Times , as well as the pulmonologist down where she lives .
She had been in and out of atrial flutter and fibrillation most of the time for the last few years .
She , on one occasion , had sinus rhythm very briefly .
Dr. Avejoh Wierst at the Pedines Community Hospital found her to be in congestive heart failure on two occasions over the last six weeks or so .
A TEE showed minimal mitral regurgitation and good left ventricular function .
Nevertheless , because of recurrent failure , it was felt that she should be transferred up to the Bri Health for further evaluation .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
On examination here , I could hear no mitral regurgitation murmur .
The observation in the hospital showed that she had recurrent runs of rapid atrial fibrillation as well as rapid supraventricular tachycardia going around 130 .
This was on diltiazem and digoxin .
At the same time , she had two 0.4 second pauses intermittently .
Because of this , the diltiazem was stopped , and she was further observed .
We could not catheterize her right away because her prothrombin time was a little too high .
Over the weekend of observation , she continued to be in supraventricular tachycardia , but also developed a 4.4 second pause on digoxin alone , which was in low therapeutic range .
She also had supraventricular tachycardia which was going up to 160 .
Therefore , a temporary pacemaker that put in on 5/4 , and diltiazem was restarted .
A cardiac catheterization was carried out on 5/5 , once her prothrombin time had fully normalized .
It showed that she had a large big right dominant coronary artery , which was free of any significant disease .
The graft to the marginal artery was open , with good runoff into a large vessel .
The left anterior descending had perhaps a mid-40% lesion only , with good left ventricular contraction and no mitral regurgitation seen on left ventricular angiogram .
There was a very modest to moderate mitral valve gradient .
The mitral valve area was calculated at 1.2 square centimeters , and then with modest exercise , the mitral valve area calculated to 1.7 square centimeters .
Thus , she had , at the most , modest mitral stenosis of no clinical significance .
With this data in hand , it appeared that her previous congestive episodes was probably related to sustained periods of rapid heart action with minimal mitral stenosis .
A permanent pacemaker was put in on 5/6/92 .
This was an Intermedex 292-03 pacemaker , set in the VVI mode with an escape rate of 65 .
She tolerated the procedure well .
On diltiazem , 60 , q.i.d. , she continued to have supraventricular tachycardia , running at around 130 , so we switched her over to verapamil , four times a day , along with digoxin , 0.125 , alternating with 0.25 , qD , which gave her a blood level of 1.0 .
On this program , she is now beginning to ambulate with a heart rate of around 79-80 , and is starting to feel a lot better .
We will ambulate her over the next couple of days .
We have stopped her Lasix , and we will be watching her daily weight , and that has been quite stable .
If she remains stable over the next couple of days , she will be discharged on this program , to be followed jointly by Dr. Avejoh Wierst and Dr. Em Neighburce .

His course in the medical ICU by system is as follows :
1. Cardiovascular :
He was in A. fib .
He was on digoxin .125 q.d. and dilt 60 .

Vancomycin was DC &apos;d on February 26 and ceftaz was DC &apos;d on March 1 .
4. Cardiovascular :
The patient was in A. fib with a rapid ventricular response .
On February 26 , the patient had an idioventricular rhythm and 6 beats of bi-directional VT on February 26 , so the digoxin was changed to q.o.d .
The patient was also switched from diltiazem to long-acting medication Tiazac that was increased to 240 mg on March 2 for rate control .
5. Endocrine :
In terms of his endocrine status , the patient was on 50 mcg of Synthroid for hypothyroidism .
The patient was started on androderm for testosterone deficiency .

HOSPITAL COURSE :
1. Falls-A PT consult was obtained to assist with ambulation .
A social work consult was also obtained and deemed that the patient has appropriate support at home and is safe at home .
The patient was placed on telemetry and had no telemetry events while an inpatient .
He was also seen by the Electrophysiology service , his pacemaker was interrogated and working fine , with no signs of recent ventricular arrhythmia .
The patient his undergoing a TTE prior to discharge to rule out a thrombus .
His TTE showed EF 45-50% , moderate cLVH , abnormal diastolic function , moderate MR , moderate TR and severe LAE .
THere was a question of ionfiltrative cardiomyopathy , and the patient underwent abdominal fat pad biopsy to assess for amyloidosis .
He also currently has an SPEP / UPEP/Beta 2 microglobulin / ACE test that are currently pending .
These should be followed up as an outaptient .
He had carotid ultrasound studies 3 months ago that were normal without evidence for stenosis .
2. Renal - cont MWF HD ; electrolytes have been stable .
Perhaps his recent falls are related to orthostatic hypotension after dialysis .
3. CV -The pt has a small area of reversible ischemia on recent MIBI , and has troponins persistently elevated in the setting of his renal disease .
His troponins remained lower than his baseline levels and there was no suspicion of ACS causing syncope .
He continued on his zocor , cozaar and labetalol .
We will now hold his coumadin given his recent falls and bleeding risk .
His aspirin was restarted prior to discharge .
4. Endo - TSH was 4.7 and normal .
5. Heme :
The patient has a macrocytosis .
His B12 level was 418 and normal .

BRIEF HISTORY :
She is a 57-year-old chronic dialysis patient who was admitted with an occluded right forearm dialysis AV graft and hyperkalemia .
The patient underwent dialysis AV graft thrombectomy and this was complicated by poor result due to stenosis and fibrosed nature of graft .
She subsequently had swelling of her left arm and ongoing hyperkalemia which was managed with Kayexalate .
She was admitted to reestablish dialysis angio access and to optimize dialysis indices .

As detailed in fellow and nurse practitioner notes .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Afebrile .
Vital signs stable .
Blood pressure 90/40 to 110/60 .
Alert and orientated .
Pleasant .
Chest :
Clear anteriorly and at bases .
Normal cardiac sounds .
Ejection systolic murmur .
Abdomen :
Benign .
Right forearm :
AV graft with extensive hematoma and ecchymosis and difficulty to access .
ADMISSION LABORATORY DATA :
Potassium 6.3 down to 4.8 , calcium 8.3 , phosphorus 5 .
BUN 35 , creatinine 5.9 , hematocrit 34.9 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
1. Dialysis :
She received dialysis via a remnant of her AV graft but clearance was suboptimal and graft will not be usable over the long-term .
She was therefore referred for a dialysis tunneled angiocatheter and will be seen by the surgical service as an outpatient for elective revision of her AV graft surgically .
Her potassium was stable postdialysis in the 4 range .
Her hematocrit was however low and with followup pending .
The patient has chronic outpatient dialysis at Nigrand Hospital And Medical Center and communication regarding her angio access status will be performed .
2. Cardiovascular :
The patient has a history of ischemic heart disease .
She had labile blood pressure following dialysis likely related to fluid removal and then sedating medications for catheter placement .
She resolved spontaneously with small fluid bolus and with no further difficulties .
3. Metabolic :
Hyperkalemia as noted .
Now stable with reestablishment of vascular access .
Anemia :
Probably a component of CKD , dilutional and blood loss with procedures .
Pending reevaluation will be monitored in an outpatient setting .
Increase dose of EPO .
No need for transfusion at this stage given the patient is asymptomatic and no episodes of GI bleeding documented .
The patient will follow up with her primary nephrologist at the Nigrand Hospital And Medical Center and with Dr. N Tland at DH .
She will have scheduled appointment made through the vascular access program for access revision .

DOB :
9/10/67 Mrs. Given is a 31 year old female with a recent history of pneumonia as well as polysubstance abuse , depression , multiple suicide attempts , who actually came to the emergency room after visiting her 51-year-old boyfriend and consuming multiple cardiac medications , in what appears to be a suicide attempt , as well as narcotics .
At about an hour and a half after the patient went home she became quite drowsy , nauseated and threw up .
She fell to the floor , choking on her vomit and was struggling to take a breath .
This was witnessed by her 12 year old daughter , who called the EMT &apos;s .
The EMTs arrived approximately five minutes after the call , found her asystolic and apneic .
They intubated her .
In the field she was given Atropine , Epinephrine and converted to an idioventricular rhythm .
She then persisted to go into EMD and then spontaneously , which is quite unclear , to normal sinus rhythm with a pulse .
Her initial systolic blood pressure was 80 .
The patient was nonresponsive in the Ponta,itri- University Medical Center emergency room. , but her blood pressure was noted to be 105/62 .
In the emergency room she received charcoal and broad speculum antibiotics and Ativan for ? of seizure activity with repetitive mouth movements .
She was evaluated by the Neurological services at that time and felt that these mouth movements might be consistent with hypoxic myoclonus .
She was admitted to our CCU for further therapy .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
As I have stated is significant for depression , history of crack Cocaine and Heroin use .
She was HIV negative about a year ago .
Kidney stones , chronic back pain , hypertension and multiple suicide attempts .
Her last was with 50 pills of Cardizem CD , as well as obesity .
MEDS AT HOME :
Include Zoloft and Verapamil .
ALLERGIES :
She has no known drug allergies .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
Her social history is significant for mother who takes care of her twelve-year-old daughter , tobacco , alcohol and multiple polysubstance abuse .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Her physical examination when she arrived to the Coronary Care Unit was notable for an agitated woman who responds to voice but was very dysarthric .
Her vital signs were temperature of 100.8 , heart rate 96 , blood pressure 140/80 , respirations 20 .
Her oxygen saturations were 95% on five liters nasal cannula .

She was admitted and placed on a bowel prep two days before surgery and was taken to the Operating Room on hospital day # 3 , 10/28/97 .
At that time , she underwent sigmoid colectomy and ventral hernia repair . ( A full account of this operation can be found in the Operative Note ) .
She tolerated this procedure without complications initially and was taken to the Recovery Room in stable condition .
Postoperatively , she had her heparin restarted , and had a PTT rising to 142.8 and then down to 92 .
Her primary postoperative development was the passage of some blood clots and blood per rectum on postoperative day # 2 .
She continued to pass blood per rectum and was transfused with one unit of packed red blood cells .
Her preoperative hematocrit was 41 and her hematocrit dropped to 30.4 on postoperative day # 2 .
This was a drop from an immediate postoperative hematocrit of 35.4 .
Upon receiving the one unit of red blood cells , her hematocrit returned to 33 , and in the two days subsequent to the transfusion , returned to 34 .
Otherwise , her postoperative course was uneventful with gradual resolution of the passage of blood per rectum .
Her heparin was discontinued when it was noted that she was bleeding per rectum and her PTT drifted to a normal range of 35 by postoperative day # 3 .

At the time of discharge , it was 1.9 , for which she received 4 mg.
On the next day , it was 1.6 and she returned to a normal dosing of 4 mg followed by outpatient draws to determine the further Coumadin dosing .
This was postoperative day # 6 , at which time she is ready for discharge .
The rest of her hospital course was unremarkable , with perioperative ampicillin , gentamicin and Flagyl discontinued on postoperative day # 1 .
She had some initial nausea but had no emesis .
Her nasogastric tube was discontinued on postoperative day # 1 , and she tolerated a regular diet by postoperative day # 3 .
She had flatus and regular bowel movements by postoperative day # 5 .

MRI showed a large heterogenous enhancing right parietal mass lesion with a possible ependymal spread .
The patient was admitted to the Neurologic Service for workup of his tumor .
The neuro-oncologist felt that because of the tremendous tumor burden that was likely causing his symptoms the patient will require open debulking as well as obtaining issue for a pathologic diagnosis .

PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
None
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
This is one of several Ponta,itri- University Medical Center admissions for this 74-year old female with multiple medical problems who developed multiple myeloma with bench Jones proteinuria over one year ago .
There were lytic lesions seen in her bones and the patient was started on intermittent courses of melphalan with Prednisone .
She had a partial response , but continued to have inappropriate amounts of gamma globulins in her blood and urine and remained anemic and poorly responsive to erythropoietin .
The patient has had one previous admission for the same symptoms a couple of months ago that she came in with this time , namely generalized weakness which in fact has on both occasions been accompanied by progressively worsening renal insufficiency .
The weakness is non focal although since she has had chronic problems with pain in her legs for uncertain reasons she was having difficulty walking .
Her appetite was gone .
She was having some nausea .
No recent history of a change in her medicines or lapse in them .
No changes in her breathing .
She did not seem sleepy or confused .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
blood pressure 130/40 , heart rate 78 regular .
Weight 132 , ( had been 126 one year previously ) .
Temperature 97 .
The patient was pale with a fine tremor of her upper extremities .
She could walk hesitantly for a few steps , was anicteric , lucid , not tachypneic .
She has flat affect at baseline and does not give may clues about somatic distress when she has some .
Her lungs were clear .
heart ; without murmur or gallop .
Her jugular venous pressure was four to five centimeters of water , carotid upstrokes normal .
soft , non tender abdomen with normal bowel sounds .
No hepatosplenomegaly or masses .
She had 2+ edema of the ankles without tender cords or erythema .
She was moving all four extremities .
Her cranial nerves were grossly intact to inspection .
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION :
Hematocrit 24.6 , white count 4.0 , platelet count 170,000 , normal differential , sodium 143 , potassium 5.7 , chloride 113 , carbon dioxide 18.9 , BUN and creatinine 71/5.2 , glucose 177 .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
The patient was admitted to the Ponta,itri- University Medical Center as a front door admission and although her electrocardiogram is equivocal , a second potassium also came back elevated so she was treated with two doses of sodium K-exulate with improvement of her potassium to within normal limits .
Over the following days , she was gently hydrated .
Her urine was alkalinized using intravenous and later oral sodium bicarbonate and her creatinine rose to a high of about 5.8 .
She was seen by the nephrology service and it was deemed quite likely that the acute and chronic renal insufficiency that had progressed causing this admission was related to her myeloma kidney .
In the weeks prior to admission she had just begun thalidomide orally as a salvage treatment for her myeloma .
She tolerated without sedation but probably was not at a therapeutic dose and it had had no impact by the time of her admission .
The patient , her son Randdor So and I had several long conversations about the potential for further renal deterioration and need for hemodialysis .
The family and the patient felt quite clearly that hemodialysis was not indicated if the underlying myeloma was not controllable .
They did agree , however to one more attempt at pulse Decadron therapy with consists of oral Decadron forty mgs PO q.day ( in divided doses ) for four consecutive days followed by four days off , followed by four days on , etc. for a total of eight sessions of four days of Decadron on .
By the time she had left she had completed only the first of the four consecutive days as expected her blood sugars went up into high 300&apos;s or 400s and she needed sliding scale regular insulin in addition to standing doses of NPH .
On the days when she was not on Decadron the standing doses of NPH were sometimes suspended because her blood sugars would get to 41 and she would have remarkably few symptoms in this setting , perhaps related to the low dose beta blockers that she also takes .
There had been a slight down turn in her creatinine by discharge to 4.7 but there was concern that she could not tolerate any greater hydration rates due to crackles in her bases although her jugular venous pressure went about six and she was never symptomatic with fluid overload .
Potassium did not appear to be a problem throughout the rest of her hospitalization .
She was also seen by the pain service who was baffled by the cause for her lower extremity leg pain that has been present for several years , not progressive , minimally responsive to narcotics and currently on a second trial of Neurontin of dubious value and would probably by the first medicine that I discontinue if she was feeling too sleepy or weak .
The problem may be a combination of degenerative joint disease with spinal stenosis as well as neuropathic changes from diabetes +/- her myeloma .
The patient also requested to be do not resuscitate , do not intubate and this was also in agreement with her son So .
The patient is transferred to a skilled nursing facility to continue the pulses of Decadron under close monitoring for blood sugars insulin regulation and to see that her potassium does not worsen and that perhaps her creatinine will improve a slight bit more , although probably not come back to normal .
She will finish her last planned pulse of Decadron by about November 25 , 2003 at which point depending on her creatinine and her status we may or may not elect further such treatments .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This 82-year-old gentleman was admitted on 01/24/02 with stuttering chest pain .
Mr. Kulrinne has a history of cardiac risk factors , including hypertension , hyperlipidemia , obesity .
He had developed intermittent chest pressure with exertion since last fall .
He was placed on cardiac medications after a stress test had revealed reversible defects in the anteroseptal and apical leads .
On medications , he continued to have some discomfort , although this was not quite clear from the outpatient setting .
An attempt at medical management was continued .
However , the patient developed crescendo pattern angina pectoris and presented on the day of admission .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
As above .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Lipitor .
Lopressor .
Aspirin .
Imdur .
Nitroglycerin prn .
ALLERGIES :
No known drug allergies .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
The patient lives with is wife .
TOBACCO :
History of heavy smoking in the past .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION :
Blood pressure 112 , Sa02 96% , afebrile .
Lungs clear .
S1 , S2 .
No significant murmurs .
Abdomen :
Obese and soft .
Extremities :
Without edema .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the floor with variable changes in his EKG .
He became pain free in the Emergency Room and was initially admitted to Evinlandcalco Hospital .
However , he developed recurrent chest discomfort on the floor with worsening of his anterior ST segments with elevation , and he was taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory .
In the cardiac catheterization laboratory , right heart catheterization showed RA 7 , RV 36/9 , wedge 16 .
He was treated with Integrelin in addition to his intravenous heparin , aspirin , and nitrates .
He was found to have the left anterior descending occluded proximally with right to left collaterals .
The circumflex was codominant with severe 90% lesion proximally in the circumflex and 50% lesion in a large OM .
The right coronary artery was codominant and had an ostial stenosis in the 70% range .
Left ventriculography revealed an akinetic anterolateral wall .
A balloon pump was placed and right heart catheterization was performed showing the above .
The patient developed worsening ST elevation on the monitor and the decision was made to go ahead and open the left anterior descending .
The procedure was reasonably complicated in that the left anterior descending had poor re-flow and two stents needed to be placed , as there was a second lesion in the mid left anterior descending .
The distal vessel was quite diseased and poor with regard to vessel quality and caliber .
A good result was obtained with a stent in the proximal left anterior descending and a stent in the mid left anterior descending and the patient went to the Intensive Care Unit on a balloon pump , intubated .
His peak CPK was in the 3000 range .
The patient developed hemoptysis while intubated and on Integrelin and heparin .
He underwent bronchoscopy , which showed no specific lesion .
In addition , chest CT showed no obvious reason for his hemoptysis , with the exception of atelectasis .
It was felt that perhaps the patient had atelectasis and perhaps some aspiration , which predisposed him to hemoptysis .
In addition , the patient had confusion and delirium .
Head CT was without any obvious intracranial catastrophe .
He was seen in consultation by the Neurology and Psychiatry services and felt to have cognitive deficits and was ultimately controlled and managed with a combination of Seroquel and Haldol .
In addition , the patient had a sitter during parts of his hospital course to keep him oriented .
The patient had a return to the cardiac catheterization lab on 2/2/02 to receive a stent to the tight circumflex .
This was uneventful , without the need for intubation , etc , and the procedure went smoothly .
He tolerated it well .
The ostial right coronary was a relatively small vessel for the patient and was not approached this admission .
The patient was transferred to Evinlandcalco Hospital .
He had difficulties with urinary incontinence and required straight catheterization for post-void residuals up until the time of this dictation .
He was still having 300 cc or so post-void remaining in his bladder .
He is followed by Dr. Squithsherl in this regard .
At the time of this dictation , the plan is for probable transfer to a rehabilitation facility for physical therapy .
He has had no recurrent heart angina pectoris or heart failure .
Of note , cardiac echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction in the 40% range with apical akinesis .

DIAGNOSIS :
Low back pain .
BRIEF HOSPITAL COURSE :
This very pleasant 37-year-old gentleman has a long history of low back pain and L4-L5 and S1 disk disease who started complaining of increased low back pain over the week preceding this admission .
He had had a previous epidural injection by Dr. Ice , but he states that the pain over the week prior to his admission made it very difficult for him to ambulate and bear weight on his left lower extremity .
He also had shooting pain down his left leg .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Notably , the patient &apos;s past medical history is significant for only the back pain .
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY :
Significant for a cholecystectomy .
MEDICATIONS AT TIME OF ADMISSION :
Included Vicodin , Motrin , and Tylenol .
ALLERGIES :
The patient claimed a medical allergy to penicillin with a reaction unknown .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Otherwise the patient , on examination , was alert and oriented x3 , in no apparent distress on general examination .
The patient had 4/5 quadriceps strength on his left lower extremity , as well as 4/5 strength in his tibial ends , EHL , and gastrocnemius soleus .
On the right side , he had 5/5 strength in his entire right lower extremity .
Reflex examination showed 2+ reflexes on the left , as far as his patellar reflex , and 1+ on the right .
MRI taken at the time of initial evaluation in the Ro Woodma Healthcare emergency department showed _multiple____ levels of degenerative joint disease and multifactorial spinal stenosis mostly at L4-L5 with central disk herniation .
ASSESSMENT :
The patient was discussed with Dr. Levels and was admitted for pain control and discussion for possible diskectomy if his pain did not improve .
Over the subsequent two hospital days , the patient &apos;s pain was managed with a combination of intravenous morphine and p.o. Percocet .
The patient &apos;s pain level was brought under control on this regimen , and surgical intervention was discussed with the patient and he said he would decide on this after discussion with his wife .
On November 18 , 2004 , as the patient &apos;s pain level was under adequate control , the patient was discharged with a prescription for Percocet and instructions to follow up with Dr. Levels in approximately two to three weeks ; he should call for an appointment .
As far as his activity , he was activity as tolerated and should avoid lifting heavy objects .
